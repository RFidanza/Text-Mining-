Lee Mendham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simplicity itself,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2020,"I haven't given any stars for Alexa integration, for the simple reason that I haven't used it. Can't be bothered with all this newfangled voice control stuff. That's why I went with the Lite version in the first place - why pay for a bunch of bells and whistles I'm not going to use?As for the rest, though, I have no complaints. It was very simple and straightforward to set up and use. The stick is designed to plug into a spare HDMI port on the TV, but wouldn't fit due to a plug in the adjacent port. Fortunately they've allowed for this eventuality by including a short HDMI extension lead, and that did the trick.After that, all I had to do was follow the on-screen instructions to link it to my wi-fi and then my streaming accounts. That was slightly time-consuming due to having to enter all the various passwords and authorization codes, but once it's done it's done and I can watch to my heart's content.The picture quality's fine and I've had no problems. Watching Netflix and Amazon Prime shows via the Fire stick is an improvement from watching via Virgin, because there's no frame-rate incompatibility, so no motion judder.If a programme is left in pause for too long the screen will revert to a photo slideshow, but pressing the ""U-turn"" button will take you back to the Resume option.As for the remote, it's much smaller and lighter than those for my TV, Blu-ray, etc., but the controls are simple and intuitive. My only minor quibble is that using the up/down/left/right buttons to search through menus can make my finger a bit sore (and yes, that wouldn't happen with Alexa, but then my throat might get sore!)Given its small size and cheapness this gadget punches way above its weight and I have no hesitation in recommending it. (And yes, iPlayer and BritBox are indeed available!)"
Lilah Ivy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2020,"Easy set up. Works perfectly. I already have a smart tv but wanted this for some extra apps and things that weren't available on my smart tv's interface. I can control my tv volume and on/off function with my echo as before, I can change channels or apps using both the firestick voice remote or my echo, and I can also control the firestick with my tv remote. So even if my kids manage to lose one or even both remotes I still have full control over all functions."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Packed in!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2020,Bought this for my son week or go and guess what its packed in!! Not working at all angry is a understatementMean people paying money to get this!I am afraid amazon seem to have a lot of dodgy products now.

Spike,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to install and as good as the bigger ones.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2020,"Installation took 5 minutes, plug in, sign in to your internet and all is good. Prime, Netflix, YouTube, iPlayer - all that in a tiny stick, plus Alexa in the remote is a great feature. Only downside is if you pause it for more than 3 minutes it signs you out - pretty frustrating when you get a call or something and no way to disable it as far as I can tell, plus it dosent always tell you if a movie is included with your prime until you click on it - still highly recommended."
Linzilou,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, delivery and installation easy just don’t leave the remote near a Rottweiler",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2020,Delivered and installed no problem and the  product looked great however the next day my dog/TRex found the remote and completely destroyed it so I’ve not even managed to watch anything yet. I looked here for a replacement remote but unfortunately couldn’t see one that matched the fire stick Lite. I wanted a proper fire stick one and not the universal one but the only Amazon one I could find was almost the same price as a new fire stick lite. Not sure why Amazon can’t make replacement remote at a more reasonable price. Waiting on my new lite now but might need to find the remote it’s own indestructible roll cage.
Milliemoofashionista,1.0 out of 5 stars,This does not work,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"The device significantly falls short of the advertised description of simply plug and play and simple to set up and use. Numerous attempts were made with a superfast broadband connection carefully following all instructions and the device will not go beyond unable to update even after following online support and including factory resets. This device seems to have defective, un useable software."
Reynolds,5.0 out of 5 stars,Junk your old Fire TV stick in favour of this,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2020,"I’ve been struggling on with an original Fire TV stick for a while. Increasingly, it been getting slower to navigate, freezes and keeps buffering even though my phone shows a download speed of 55mbps over wi-fi in the same room.This new version, despite it being entry level, is amazing in comparison. No more 5 second lag when pressing the buttons or freeze frames during content viewing. The experience is just as it should be. It even automatically connected to my account and wi-fi when I first turned it on."
MsSteeple,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as my old Fire box and the revised design of the remote is dreadful,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 December 2020,"I only bought this because I couldn't load Britbox on my older version of Amazon Fire and it is definitely not as good. As others have noted, the handset is almost impossible to get into, so utterly unfit for anyone who may be less-abled or elderly - the old version of the handset was easy to open and I now dread changing the batteries. My other big gripe is that when I leave the firestick on standby it often loses the sound so I keep having to unplug and re-plug it in to get the sound back, which is extremely annoying. I much preferred my old model which never gave me any problems. Please test new versions thoroughly in future before rolling them out to check they can be used easily by all of your customers and that they work as they should! Thanks,"
S. Lovell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Impressed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2020,"I've been vaguely planning to replace our aging YouView box for a while, and when I saw an offer on the Fire TV Stick, I thought I'd give it a go. I was a little nervous that it might be underpowered (it's very small) and that the using Wifi rather than a network cable might result in poor performance too.I needn't have worried. Where our YouView box had often seemed slow and unresponsive the FireStick is snappy, and the modern interface makes browsing the available options a breeze. There is support for all the major ""on demand"" players (including Plex, which is another win for me). I haven't noticed any significant lag related to using Wifi either (though our router and the FireStick are less than a metre apart).The only downside compared to the YouView box is the inability to record and/or pause normal TV, but that was a feature we very rarely used ... and for catch up TV is redundant unless you're wanting to build a collection rather than simply watch once.So, the YouView box has now been unplugged and I'm not looking back!"
fanny aggs,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken icons,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 October 2020,"Just received 2 Amazon lite firesticks  to replace my ageing 1gen sticks there seems to be a problem an inbuilt virusin them there produce broken icons for side loaded apps on the start up page, I have been on utube and many  lite firestick have this problem only when Amazon puts an update out to resolve this problem i will be sending them back, Come on Amazon play fair with your loyal customers Reg"
Mr. C Bell,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good streaming stick, but 3 stars because Amazon force increasing amounts of advertising onto you",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"As a streaming stick works fine: easy to set up and use, good performance, good range of apps.However...Be warned that Amazon treat this as a compulsory advertising vehicle, with its user interface prioritising what they want to push onto you as opposed to what you want to receive.  Their latest update (20/12/2020) makes this even worse by allocating even more space and priority to this with, so far as I can see, no mechanism for removing banner ads and ""sponsored content"" (ie rubbish no sane person would ever want) short of hacking the operating system.Given that this is something which you pay for I find such behaviour unacceptable."
G. R. Wilkinson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Rule 1 - Switch off at the wall, then back on again",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2021,"It is well worth remembering Rule 1 ... Because that's the one you will use the most .  There are not as many FREE to watch films / programmes as you would imagine. The concept of the Fire stick is amazing .. and if you speak without a regional accent in perfect queens English the voice remote will work great.  My first fire stick lasted around 5 or 6 months then stopped working, the online support is very good (I suppose it is so often used that it has to be) They soon discovered mine was faulty so offered me a FOC exchange which lasted a further 8 month (just beyond its warranty strange that isn't it) ... So I bought a new one so we were able to complete the watching of a series we had gotten in to ... So its new , it no longer controls the volume etc but its ok.  But enjoy it while it lasts because once you switch it off , the very next ,in fact practically every time you switch it on it will tell you it has lost Network connection and you will need to revert to Rule 1 ... Switch it off at the wall then back on again... The Firestick has been around long enough now to have ironed out its teething problems , but that would mean that you would not need to BUY a replacement from Amazon ... its a win win Product for Amazon and hours of frustration for the user . Would I ever buy another one ... yes of course I will in 13 months time just after my warranty expires ."
Mike P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works off USB cable!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,"I purchased this for use with my Viewsonic M1+ Projector. Set it up on the tv first (downloaded Netflix, iPlayer, Prime Video, etc) and signed in to various accounts - very easy to do, you can use a browser on your phone. Streams everything perfectly, inc Netflix. Comes with a standard plug and USB cable but my projector is portable, so tried plugging a short micro USB to USB cable into the USB 1 socket (5v, 1 amp output). Works perfectly - this firetv stick needs 5V, 900 milliampes. So now portable - will be able to watch Netflix outside on our 100” screen! Wondering if I can connect to G4 signal off the phone if away from wi-fi: if yes, will update this review.Only 1080p but that is sufficient for this projector. Very clear picture, no stutter on sound (in stereo) and, by utilising the USB cable, totally portable. Please note - the USB cable didn’t work when plugged into my tv but that may be a setting issue, also the tv is about 6 years old. I would think most modern TVs output the nescessary power from a USB socket, which means one less plug hole needed!Very pleased - especially at a cost of £19.99 in BF sale...."
Pydar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good picture quality,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,"I found the Fire stick fairly easy to install, except for the Alexa voice control remote.  This still has not worked and I feel I don't have enough time to go into it all again.  The remote worked at first except for the voice control.  Having had to unplug it from the mains at one point, I then found I had to re-install it from the start with passwords etc.  At that point, I gave up on the remote through lack of time but will get back to it later having looked at all the instructions online.  Excellent picture though and I can use it with the TV's own remote for the time being."
◀Daddy Android▶      🇬🇧,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020
TOxfordshire,3.0 out of 5 stars,Clunky and glitchy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2020,"Bought this to temporarily replace my Apple TV box. Whilst a big price difference differentiates the two products, I have been disappointed by the clunky controls when compared to Apple, the lack of apps (Apple has Now TV in addition to the ones I have on Amazon).There have been several glitches when the Fire Stick hasn’t responded and allowed me to go to the Home Screen, stating a network issue, this has resulted in a hard rest of the device (unplugging it), this despite the Echo Dot sat next to the TV still being connected to the internet along with my other devices too.I have also been disappointed by the adverts on the Home Screen, not helped with the clunky controls I have selected adverts when I have wanted apps and content.So for £29, this isn’t bad, just manage your expectations if you have used other superior products like Apple and Apple TV. Plus save £10 and dont buy the £39 version as most TV controls can work the device and the on off / volume buttons too (Sony Bravia here). And if they can’t, is it too much of a hassle to have two remotes?"
AL,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"Runs smoother and quicker than older models but not happy with the fact it does not go into standby very well. What I mean by that is, when I turn the TV off for the night and come back to it the next day, the fire stick often won't come back on. I get either a blue screen with ""no signal"", a plan black screen as if it is sleeping but won't come back on or once I got a screen full of ""static"". I have to unplug the power cable for a min and start again which can be a pain with it stuck behind the TV.Also, while the remote looks almost identical, the rear door for the battery is a different design which feels very flimsy, doesn't fit so well and has some sharp edges.If I had paid more for it, I might return it but after picking up at a reduced price it doesn't seem worth it."
Hilary Weinstein,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant Addition to the Device Family,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2020,"When son took away the PS4 we were devastated as we would not be able to watch Prime or Netflix anymore.  He told us to buy a Fire Stick.  We did without knowing anything about it!  Best buy ever.  Not too pricey, easy to install and works like a dream.  Highly recommend for those of us with older TVs that don't have automatic access to Iplayer, Netflix and lots of other great choices."
Simon Duggan,1.0 out of 5 stars,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2020,I have now had four yes four different amazon fire sticks and they all after a while won't even start up let alone do anything else utter utter rubbish do not I repeat do not !!!!!!!! waste your money on buying the product
Gonk,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Handy HD streamer, but limited functionality.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2020,"Handy HDMI streaming device for use with an HD TV, but could not get it working with my VGA monitor, also found it had poor echo cinema sound quality via WiFi.Using with an old PC monitor I found it wouldn’t remember the 720p VGA video resolution & defaulted back to 1080p when I switched off the monitor. The auto video resolution feature didn’t seem to work properly with VGA. I used to have no problem with my old 1st Gen Fire TV Stick. In the end I had to swap out my old Dell monitor for a Samsung 24” HD TV which works fine.Also the WiFi bandwidth on this model seems to be limited compared to the 4K version, the picture is fine with 1080p movies but the cinema sound via WiFi was very low bit rate and terrible quality (even right next to the WiFi router on 5GHz) So I would recommend either the 4K Fire TV Stick, or use the Amazon Fire TV Ethernet Adapter if you wish to setup cinema sound with an echo device."
davold,1.0 out of 5 stars,It does not work very well in fact its pure rubbish,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"It was on special offer and our old one was starting to play up(probably programmed to do so), so I thought great. Wrong..... it turns off when it wants to, it loses signal with the wifi router at will. When you turn the TV  off it will not(the fire stick)turn on again unless you get up unplug it from the power wait 10 seconds then plug it back in again. I tried talking to someone about it but they say my STD code is not recognised so they won't call you. You try the online chat and they are rubbish....more terrible than BT so that is bad. So its going back. The worst thing is the customer service is sooooo bad I feel like leaving prime altogether...why bother selling an awful product...that is your flagship then giving no help whatsoever....astoundingly bad eggs."
Bonedrum,1.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrated,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,Less than two weeks after purchase the remote and fire stick stopped communicating. Without being able to manoeuvre the screen it is impossible to go to settings to reinstate the device. Ironically I bought this fire stick to replace an existing one that also did this but was out of warranty. Despite trying everything suggested on forums the fire stick will not re-pair. I would like to contact the seller rather than return or exchange the product but this seems ridiculously complicated on Amazon. Not impressed!
Raymond Webb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fire stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,The fire stick is easy to install just plug in to the television via an HDMI lead and plug into the mains. The fire stick will update its software to ensure it is fully up to date. You then can add various apps to the stick by following the on screen instructions. You will need a tablet or computer to verify your accounts but other than that it is quite easy to set up. Most apps are available for free but some will need a pay to view.The picture is very good although on some apps it does have slight reduction to in quality. Overall I would recommend it as it gives you a great range variety of things to watch and the Alexa voice control is a useful tool to have although you will need to lean how to use it correctly.
JPK,4.0 out of 5 stars,Improvement on earlier models.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2020,Iplayer and ITV hub now available.Bought this to use in my motorhome and have found that it's a big improvement on previous models. Works well with a very limited Wifi signal and so far has not had any of the pauses that I got with my older firetv 4k stick. Simple and intuitive interface.
Helen,1.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn't use straight out the box so ended up costing more,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2021,"I switched from Apple TV (1st gen) to Amazon Fire Stick as there were new apps, such as BritBox and Disney+, that we couldn't get on Apple TV unless we did AirPlay, which was a bit of a faff (and kept dropping whenever we paused). Only 4th gen Apple TV allows you to add apps, which was £150, so this seemed a cheaper alternative.However, it wasn't as cheap as I thought! For a start, we needed to buy a longer USB cable, as we use a projector (not a TV) which was too far away from the plug, so for the sake of an extra 10cm, we needed to pay £10 for another cable. Then, to my horror, I found the Amazon Fire Stick has no audio outlet! I guess this is fine if you are using with a TV, but with a projector, you'll need to buy an HDMI Audio splitter, which was another £20.Once we did get it working (now with loads of cables - ugh) the menu screen is horrible, and it takes several clicks to get to what would be a much more sensible homepage of the various apps. I really don't like this, and wish I'd stuck to the old Apple TV, which - though out of date - was a lot nicer to use, except for having to airplay Disney+. It just doesn't compare to Apple TV device, or even the Now TV stick (which I got FREE with my account, but am no longer subscribing). I suggest Amazon consider giving this stick free to Prime members. Otherwise, wish I hadn't bothered.There are much better streaming devices out there."
Honesty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Turn a TV into to a smart TV for a fraction of the price!! My #1 purchase!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2020,"Amazing once set up. Can turn your basic TV into a full media desktop.. The best bit you can use your voice..To both search and stream things such as netflix, YouTube and much much more.Personally it has helped both my parents.My amazing mum because she works none stop! My step dad.. because he is blind and has mobility issues, diabetes etc so he needs alot of help!!! This is perfect because you can search via voice!Yes it'll take some getting used to, but any sort of independence is a positive and only that.Possibly the best rated item I've bought from here.. Once I got it working.You could be thinking, "" it'll be difficult"". but just like anything new it takes time.It's very simple, once you've had several lessons! Do not let it scare you away some change is good and this is growth at it's best.You won't regret this purchase!!I hope I've helped in some way.Merry Christmas everyone. Keep going.We will endure.All the family love these!!As they are voice controlled.. my step dad loves these being that he's blind and has mobility issues.It takes some getting used to but there's only one button to press for voice control and off you go! He's getting there and it helps with a bit of independence which is only positive for people with needs!Honestly couldn't rate this higher.. Still my best purchase.. I bought three so far..can't say I won't be back for more because I will."
Lindsay R. Bayne,3.0 out of 5 stars,Limited success on first try.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"OK, so we bought this to watch the autumn rugby internationals not otherwise available - but there were several pauses in the transmission, maybe due to buffering, not sure - the picture would freeze, a blue circle appeared - when motion returned, it was poor definition, blurred. Overall, coverage needs much to be desired compared to BT and SKY, and not easy to discover coverage. We probably need to explore more, but not that satisfied."
Keith_T,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well even with seriuosly slow broadband,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2020,"We live in the country and have a an exchange only line which means - until someone pulls their finger out, broadband is horribly slow - maximum 2.6 mbps. Firestick installed simply using wifi and streams well albeit at standard definiton. - almost viewed 3 series of Man in the HIgh Castle now.... rewind and ff is a bit slow but overall everything is watchable at this speed and a wired connection which I have for my sky Q box is not needed.Definitely a real bonus especially if you already have Prime"
alex review,5.0 out of 5 stars,not anything like the hassle i experienced with an alternative product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"my initial review of this product is that's is super easy to set up,  everything is well packaged and the product itself is well thought out.  setup was simple to achieve.  the only thing that initially confused me was the hdmi needed the adapter dongle to be used to get the plug/socket to fit correctly.  i thought all hdmi plug/sockets are standard but obviously not - this is dealt with in the instructions anyway,  and caused nothing but a couple of seconds of puzzlement why the unit didnt fit into the hdmi socket of the tv.  5 seconds later all was well, just use the dongle adapter that's supplied.the stick was already aware of my i.d. and did a software update immediately.  how it got access to the internet i have not a clue.  part of the setup (later on) just involves adding the router password to the stick,  which is accomplished by using an onscreen keyboard and the remote control.the remote control's battery compartment is the best ive ever seen, the design is sturdy and works well.alexa works just fine using the microphone on the remote.  press and keep pressed the alexa button and speak your favourite tv program and up it comes !i cannot honestly give this amazon streaming device anything other than a 100% mark as a review.5 stars !"
Philip Knowles,1.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn't wake up from sleep.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2021,"I like many others on the Amazon forums have noticed that the device will not power on from a sleep state without cycling the power switch at the wall. Quite rubbish really that I have to get up and physically switch the adapter off/on again to get it to work. Have tried all the remote buttons even the voice and nothing fixes this. Obviously an issue with the current firesticks, my old one never used to do this but alas that died after a couple of years use. Won't be replacing it nor contacting Amazon support. Naughty Jeff!"
kaleta,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"Alex's works fine and the picture is fine, but the remote feels loose in my hand, it doesn't feel solid at all.The device itself is ok but I've had a constant problem of it not turning on and it doesn't seem to always respond to the remote, so I find myself having to take the wire out, wait abit, then put it back in for it to work, at first it wasn't so bad but now I have to do it every time I want to watch it...which is annoying. Would return it but I bought it through someone & can not be bothered with the hassle ... I only really got it to watch Disney plus & the discovery plus app thing but it doesn't seem to have the discovery one."
N. Falconer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Plenty of apps available to rejuvenate an old TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,"I bought this to augment an old Toshiba Smart TV which had long since stopped running iPlayer and never had a lot of streaming app support anyway. The rest of the TV is still perfectly fine so worthwhile adding better Smart support.So far I'm happy with the Fire TV app support, everything I've installed seems to work fine, from subscription services to free service and also DLNA support.I've tested Alexa a little for finding programmes and it works, but to be honest I'm not that bothered about voice recognition.The only niggle I'm having is sometimes after powering up the TV and stick there is no picture on the HDMI input despite the TV recognising a Fire TV stick is connected.  I have to cycle the usb power to reboot the stick. and then everything is fine.  I suspect this may be a problem with the TV and when it syncs with HDMI inputs."
Rebecca J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Turn your TV into a smart TV for pounds,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2021,"Love it it’s turned my ordinary TV into a smart TV saving me £100’s!!! Bought because we wanted Disney+ and Discover+ both so easy to stream!!! I’m not technically minded but this was so easy to set up literally plugged in and downloaded the apps I wanted!!!! The voice recognition is brilliant too I’m able to press the button and ‘speak’ my choice!! Alexa works like a dream too only issue I have is sometimes this Alexa, my echo and kindle fire are all competing to answer!!! Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting the new channels but not needing or able to update to a state of the art TV just yet!! Also able to unplug and switch tv mid show with no issues which helps when ready for bed but the show hasn’t finished!!"
Ella Sarip,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the previous one,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2020,"I didn't realize I still had a 1st generation FireTv Stick wich was starting to playing up before dying. This new version is way better and faster. The remote works and is easier to use. Works good with Alexa apart from an application called ViKi. When I pause it works, but when I want to resume the video Alexa doesn't recognise the command for that application but I guess it doesn't have much to do with the functionality of this FireTv."
Simon Says,5.0 out of 5 stars,A whole new world,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"I bought a FireStick simply for My5 that had stopped working on my smart TV. I had used Amazon Prime on my Ipad and streamed it to my TV but the FireStick now mitigates the need to do this.The unit was very easy to set up and link to my Prime account and this opened up a new world of programmes which has been it most beneficial attribute. I now find I use the FireStick for most of our programs, having found a wealth of drama's like The Night Watchman, Goliath and Damages which are all high-quality programs unavailable on terrestrial tv.Alexa is a useful addition, allowing you to ask to find particular program categories or simply the days weather.With a bit of fiddling, I have also managed to get Italian TV by using a VPN app. Its a bit pedantic in its use but at least I can catch the news and a few Rai programs without the need for a satellite dish.Costing less than £20 (a Black Friday deal) I can't complain as it is used daily and provides far more options for viewing given the lacklustre offerings from many terrestrial tv stations."

Yang,1.0 out of 5 stars,fault device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2020,"I have purchased a couple of fire sticks previously and am generally happy with them (the remote control for one of them failed and I had to use mobile app to control the stick). Unfortunately the latest one I purchased apparently has some faults/defectives as it produces clicking noise and flashing screen every few minutes. To my disappointment, I have contacted the supplier and reported the defective, the automatic reply says a replacement will be sent to me with no additional charge. However after a week time, still nothing happens. I tried to get in touch with customer care via online chat, but was thrown to online help page with no single human reply. It's really a bad experience."
Charles Foran,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not as described due to Error PLR_PRS_CALL_FAILED,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2020,"How ridiculous that the product that is specifically made for its own company's video streaming service refuses to play those videos from the get go and no amount of tweaking, changing settings,  rebooting and running through online forums looking for the non-existent silver bullet will fix it. As a long time echo user i am sorely disappointed in Amazon for letting customers down with such a buggy product.  My intention was to buy two more for TVs in my house, but that certainly will not happen now. I am looking at my echos as well as I wanted an integrated system."
Reaper,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2021,Verified Purchase
BlueberryPi,4.0 out of 5 stars,So much better than previous models!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021,"Bought this on a black Friday deal, as we had the first generation Fire Stick and it was struggling to say the least. With Prime Video it was usually okay, but Netflix was awful with constant freezing and stuttering (even with fast broadband).With this model, video playback on anything is absolutely superb! No buffering or audio issues, it just plays. I most often use Prime Video, Netflix and stream NHK World Japan and honestly it's a joy after months of frustration with the last one.I've also downloaded Earth Cam, allowing me to view webcams all over the world. The image quality from these is just superb in 720P or 1080P (dependent on camera selected).The voice remote works well when it wants to, but other times it just won't search with voice. But when it does, even with strong accents it finds what you want right away.I couldn't find a straight answer before purchasing whether this would solve playback issues compared to the first gen. But it really does.Absolute best purchase I've made in a while now that we can enjoy movies and series when we want with no unexpected drama!For anyone who hasn't used one before, it couldn't be any easier to set up. Just plug in and follow the easy instructions. Then enjoy searching the many apps to find what you want."
The Old Clucker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2021,"I have the TV stick with Alexa and tv controls on my main smart tv and wanted to update the tv stick on my bedroom tv as it was getting on a bit and wasn't up to streaming high demand apps such as Disney+/STAR. It was taking ages to load some apps and had the spinning disc of doom quite often, or the picture freezing. I was so impressed with the latest stick with tv controls but couldn't justify the extra money for a tv I don't use that often so I decided to get the Amazon Fire TV stick Lite without tv controls. It's absolutely fab! The tv and firestick are plugged into an Amazon smart plug so I just tell Alexa to turn the plug on and then use the tv control to select which 'source' ie; the firestick  and then use the firestick control to choose what I want to stream, not needing to touch the amazon fire stick control again, and using the tv control for volume control. Unless i want to skip through something then obviously have to use the firestick control. But it's no problem at all having to use the tv remote infact to be honest, it's a lot simpler, well for me anyway.It's very fast, loads in seconds and no spinning circle of death while it loads apps. Over the moon with it. Infact to be honest, wish I'd bought the lite for the main tv now but never mind. They're both great products. I can highly recommend both."
Tom B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great piece of kit, recommended!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,"The picture quality, ability to link to other Alexa devices and the sheer scale of available apps for the Fire TV stick make it a great buy. I realise most people will already have smart TVs etc by now but trust me, the Fire TV is the best bet for ensuring apps are always up to date and working optimally - especially as TV manufacturers discontinue support for their models on a regular basis.This iteration is particularly easy to use and the Alexa Voice Remote, even without any other Alexa device integration, does a fantastic job on it's own and makes finding whatever you are looking for (regardless of the application) really simple.Recommended for anyone looking to boost their viewing options!"
Sutton Coldfield caz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to implement even for those not very tech savvy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020,"Very easy to set up and run.  Bought mainly to watch films rather than continue to buy DVD's  so using Amazon Prime at the moment but may consider Netflix later. One thing which I came unstuck on were those apps you have to pay for.  Now my husband is a dinasor  and does not use a computer, mobile phone etc  Went for a bath and left him with the remote and the next day I find a debit from Amazon for a The Chase App -  a programme he hates and somehow he had bought it -  he doesn't know how but I can see it is easy to do. Wonderful Amazon deleted it and refunded and suggested I avoid it again by adding parental controls which allow purchases only on implementation of a code known only to me  -  parental controls for a 73 year old  !!!  That has been done now so should avoid that issue again.  One more thing -  did have to adjust the tv because the instructions across the top to enable me to select options was off the screen. Easy enough to do in the technical section.  Suggest it is worth while spending sometime playing about with all the screens so you get a feel for what you can do to make it an even better experience.  Certainly turning out to be value for money  - watching a film on Amazon prime virtually every night."
Mr. M. D. MCMAHON,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! What a clever device!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2021,"We bought this to watch live sports streams from Amazon Prime. We wanted something less faffy than hooking up a laptop computer to the TV - which did work well but my wife found it too complicated and inconvenient mto control. The TV is a 9-year-old Panasonic and is unable to link itself to Amazon Prime, which some more-modern TVs can.I was not disappointed. The device was easy to set up, though I was initially puzzled by the hand control unit - not immediately obvious that navigation is performed by pressing the bezel surrounding the ""select"" button.My dear wife struggles with technology and I was wondering how she would cope. She not only took to it readily and worked it out for herself - she discovered that the TV control handset would also control the Fire Stick - the appropriate buttons function on it in the same manner as those on the proper handset! Effectively a one-control solution - though not in the way advertised. The Fire Stick seems to recognise the Panasonic handset signals; I don't know how. Has anyone else experienced this?Yes, I am very pleased with this. It works well from our Wi-Fi and gives a sharp, clear, steady picture.We have not bothered with the voice control so far. The hand controls work so well we don't need to."
Dan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Next time think I'd get the one with TV controls.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2021,"Works really well, loads of channels to choose from and I'm not on prime or anything, so I just get the free stuff. In terms of setting up, it took almost no effort, which on one hand made was great, on the other, was a little worrying. I assume it connected with the echo dot I have and got all the WiFi details from that, because I didn't have to do anything to connect it and when I checked the details for the connection, it was connected to the correct network with the correct password.In terms of appearance, fits behind the TV neatly and takes power from one of the TVs USB ports, so it's basically invisible. I'm on basic broadband, so speeds of upto 8MB/s and picture quality etc seems great, but I also live alone, so perhaps if you had more people taking up the bandwidth it might have issues.I've not used it a lot, when I bought my house it had a TV wall mount in a room I don't really watch TV in, so bought a cheap TV to cover it only to realise that there were no satellite or aerial sockets in the room. Tried a couple of different indoor aerials, but could only ever get a couple of channels, this essentially makes the TV viable again, though it doesn't get a lot of use.Voice controls seem fine, but the TV doesn't automatically go into standby when you put the firestick into sleep mode, so the control with a TV standby button would probably have been better.Have lowered my rating by one star as have just found out there is no voice command to put the firestick itself into sleep mode, you have to do it manually."
Tom.T,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Full on Fire , Excellent Value. !!!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2020,"Great value alltho I'd say the 4k stick is also good value and worth the extra especially if you buy when on sale. I feel the firestick lite was released in a hurry as some of the mainstream apps weren't working at release like BBC and a few others alltho I believe these are all minor issues and all resolved my only complaint is some sideloaded apps load without their icons showing which seems abit of a petty slightly spiteful thing to change but maybe that will be resolved also. But I paid £20 each for these lite versions on sale and you get alot for your money even at full price they're brilliant fully fledged firesticks with newer operating system and work very well, the volume control and power buttons are omitted but it's so cheap it matters not , and for not much more you can buy the version with those extra controls the choice is yours. I personally rate the firestick lite very highly and is a great idea to have a cheaper version that still as good for those who are struggling financially or just want a spare for bedrooms or travelling. A1 Amazon."
Michael Webb,1.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this to watch BBCi player as advertised.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2020,I tried to use it to receive BBCi player.  However I cannot get it to work. So for me it's a complete waste of money. If anyone can help me I would be most grateful.
A. J. Maclean,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value Great quality and ease of use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2021,"I bought the Fire Stick Lite for the TV in my bedroom. It's an old small flat screen TV (2006) that is barely used because it's picture quality, sound etc is pretty poor against todays TVs. However, plug in a Fire stick and all that changes. I was amazed at the improvement to sound and picture quality  via the Fire Stick Lite. I was genuinely thinking of getting rid of this TV but not any more. I'm not one for watching TV in bed but after seeing and hearing the difference I've  changed my mind and given the TV a reprieve. You do need to remember that you can't control your TV with the Fire Stick Lite or Alexa voice but how hard is it to turn up the volume or turn the TV on and off using the TVs own remote? The Fire Stick Lite works the same as the full Fire Stick. You can use the buttons or use Alexa to perform the functions for you. I already have a full Fire Stick on my main TV and was pleased to find that the 2 fire sticks integrated with each other during the setup process. This meant that all my preferences, movies etc that I had saved on my main Fire Stick were transferred to the Fire Stick Lite with no lose whatsoever. Its really great value for money and I would definitely recommend it."
Constantgardner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple to use for something that does so much.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2021,"I'm in my 90s, don't have very dexterous hands and have reached the stage when I can't be bothered to learn new technology, so my son set this up for me and wrote some basic instructions on how to use the remote.To my surprise I've got the hang of it quite quickly, I like being able to ask Alexa, such a polite young lady, to play music by style or artist or to find programmes. Getting to learn the words to use is a bit of trial and error but we get there in the end.iPlayer works like it does on the PC more or less, similar videos are just below rather than to the side and I've found things I never knew were there, like the live corral reef cam.Using the direction and select buttons is the same as with any remote and unlike my computer I don't feel I can do anything so stupid it will rash.Lastly my son says I should mention that I don't have a particularly fast Internet speed, it runs at between 4 and 10mbps but the picture on my 24"" TV is perfectly fine and there's only a brief pause while things load, then no buffering at all.I think if I can use it anyone can, it's technology for people who don't like technology."
Bob Owen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"2020 Fire TV Stick Lite, way better than the 2016 Fire TV Box.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2021,"I bought the Fire TV Box in the photo 5 years ago because it was 4 core and the old Stick was 2 core at the time.  But the wifi was hopeless on the Box both in terms of the 5GHzchannels it could receive and the signal strength.  The new Stick Lite supports the full range of 5 GHz channels from 36 to at least 157 that my Oppo 5G router puts out and the received signal strength is always very good.  The 4 cores in the new Stick Lite are at least as good or better than the old Box and take up a fraction of the space and electrical power.  I am getting used to the new UI but I am struggling with the TV button on the remote because the old Box remote did not have the TV button.  I don't seem to be able to disable the TV button either but maybe I can slice it off cleanly with a new Stanley blade?  At least the old Box did me a favour by dying and forcing me to buy the new Stick Lite so I am pleased about that and the old Box will make a nice drink mat.PS  I sliced the TV button off with a Stanley blade in a window scraper so the remote is perfect now, see photo."
Read-a-holic,4.0 out of 5 stars,Turns my TV into smart TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2020,"Bought this device while on special offer for 17.99 so thought was worth a shot for the price and I am quite impressed with it, was easy to install and like the fact that you can use voice command on the remote, however does not come with any instructions worth mentioning, had to go to YouTube to find what the device is capable of, no tutorials on the device that I'm aware of anyway. Also, not very impressed with Amazon Prime as a lot of the content is to rent or buy, even quite old films and TV content, I'm already paying 7.99 a month, should not have to fork out more to watch content, of course some are free to view, just not all of it what I necessarily want to watch, thankfully there's other ways to stream so for that this is good as I don't have a fancy smart TV, which essentially, is what this device does, so now I can watch all the catch up channels on my TV instead of my phone as I no longer subscribe to Sky or Virgin media so don't have the ability to record programmes anymore, so catch up is essential for me"
Kevin Warrington,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2021,"TV without an aerial connection and no smart apps, so a simple Fire stick seemed to be the best solution. Everything needed is in the box and set up is simple. Loads of additional apps to download if needed and the only tedious bit is registering your account for each of the streaming apps, whihc took a little time.Video output is 720P, whihc is a bit odd as it is a 1080P TV - and I can't see any option to change this. As it is a small screen and we mostly use it to listen to radio stations, it isn't a problem.Cannot get the hang of using Alexa, so just use the simple remote control.I've found a couple of minor problems: first, if I turn the TV off, when I turn it back on again, the sound is lost and I need to power cycle the Firestick to recover. secondly, there is no obvious way to turn the firestick off, other than removing power, so it seems that it will sit there streaming data all the time.In summary - it does what I needed and hoped it would do and was **MUCH** cheaper than the alternatives of installing an aerial lead or buying a new smart TV"
RKaur,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Affordable, does the job",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021,"I bought this after my Sky box stopped working and my TV does not connect well to the wireless. It provides access to the main apps. Picture quality is good for the price. Maybe not as sharp and sometimes it goes a little blocky with busy pictures like birds flying on animal programmes, but it is negligible. I haven't tried Alexa on it.It did have a couple of glitches with sound disappearing after switching the TV off and on without sending the stick to sleep first and buffering, but switching the stick off or restarting fixed it. No major problems so far. It also has mirroring.The home menu could be better to access the apps, it instead has a strip of some of your apps. The rest of the screen has recommended programmes and promotional material. You have to go into another page to see all your downloaded apps.It was too wide to slot into the side HDMI port on the TV. I had another HDMI cable in the back of the TV so had to use the extension for the stick because there was not enough room for it. It does hang down as a result but hasn't disconnected. It plugs in with USB to plug, although it could probably be slotted into a USB port on the TV for power.Overall, a cheap way to access apps if TV isn't smart or has wireless problems. Maybe expensive models have better picture quality but it is acceptable on this one. Does the job and I would recommend it. I might try the next model up at some point and keep this for the spare TV."
EddieB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice price and works well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"There are already so many good feedback points made that there is little I can add other than it was almost a simple plug and play once I had realised it was the the network password and not the Router needed.I am 70 years old and had computers ever since they evolved from simple 1MB games machines, so I am pretty well up on techy bits and I found this streaming add-on way simpler than others I played around with (cheap versions) over the last 5 or 6 years. Great picture and virtually no time lapse.The time lapse that I mean are the many you get when using other systems . A TV in one room using Freeview is a fraction ahead of the TV using Virgin Tivo boxes and even then if you look at The BBC news on 601 (on Virgin) and the BBC news on 101 (still on Virgin) the images are a good second later on 601. I can watch BBC TV on my PC stream it to the Lounge and finding, loading and playing is way faster than watching it on the slow buffering Virgin Tivo boxes."
Martin Koss,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dreadful - No sound through HDMI - only Bluetooth,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"I have an original FireStick and other than being painfully slow, it worked.This is the second of the new versions (I originally bought the 4K version to have on a 4K monitor on my desk but that failed because the 4K only works on a Smart TV (as tech support told me) so I bout the 'lite' version (as advised by Amazon Tech Support) but it too does not output any sound via HDMI, only BlueTooth.I have spent hours looking at so many 'tips' on the web about how to fix this but nothing worked.I even did a factory reset and still no sound through HDMI.I know all my cables and the system works because I have a HDMI BluRay player in the same system and the sound gets to my sound bar absolutely fine - but not from the FireStick. I've swapped cables, tested everything and everything works except sound from FireTV / FireStick Lite. Terrible system.Very badly designed.Would NOT recommend this."
Organum,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fab but pity about the USB power,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"Amazed at how much faster is than my old stick. Really responsive and apps like Britbox fully useable now.My only gripe, hence the 4 stars, is that when using the TV as the power source (like my last stick) periodically a warning comes up tha not enough power is supplied but the unit works just fine. To have a power lead dangling down the wall for an adapter is a no no in my hour !"
T. I. Charlesworth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product  !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2021,"I bought this as my Sony Bravia 5 year old smart TV has never been able to get ITV and is now saying that BBC iplayer is overloading it . Very poor and has put me off the brand . I was eying up a new TV to get over these issues, despite the TV still delivering an excellent picture.  Starting to feel a bit miffed over spending another £600 when I thought of getting a fire stick. For under £20 I have now got a fully functioning smart TV . ITV , no problem  BBC no problem........what is even more amazing is that my Sony TV appears to have  "" learned "" how to operate the fire stick so I only have to use the one remote ! I have no idea how this happened , it was certainly nothing I did , I'm not that clever.  Great product.  So pleased ,that the next TV I buy for a different room may be a non smart model with a fire stick....I'm thinking that,  knowing Amazon , it may be more "" future proof "" ."
Peter C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Latest Addition to the Fire stick Range,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"I bought the Fire stick lite in the recent Black Friday sale, a great price for for an entry level product.  Firstly, I would say the streaming quality at the max 1080p is really smooth with no buffering or juddering during playback. Comes with the latest Amazon launcher interface which is a welcome addition. As a user of NowTV this is now available on the Lite and works great.  On a down side the 1GB memory is very small considering the lite uses around 650mb to run leaving you with 350mb to run your programs like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube and other apps you might add.  If you don't have an 4K TV this would be a great chose for casual use.  Finally, to get the best performance from this product regularly restart the fire stick to refresh the memory to keep it performing at it's it peak, however I would recommend you do this on whichever fire stick you own, it's just good house keeping."

Had our replacement for a couple of weeks now and beginning to see a similar fault. When the tv is first turned on the firestick isn’t detected and the remote won’t turn it on (tv shows no input detected) so having to resort to unplugging and plugging it back in. This is not a consistent fault with this replacement, and our original firestick (fully working just replaced by the firestick lite to include Alexa voice search) was in the same HDMI port without issue so I have to believe it’s a fault with the product..."
E. King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good stick. Had problems with the stick freezing/locking up, problem is resolved now.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2021,"I had problems with the stick freezing up, I'd start watching something and after a short time the picture would freeze and the remote wouldnt work (also happened in the menus when left idling). But it turned out not to be the stick but instead my TV. I had to switch my TV from HDMI_2 to HDMI_1 then back to HDMI_2 and everything came back to life. Weird, I have a basic TV, but on the other hand I never had problems with HDMI_2 before when I had a dvd player plugged in to it.FireTV Support take notice of this, because when you gave me support you didn't suggest testing the TV, instead you had me checking for updates and factory resetting the FireTV stick, which didn't solve the problem.I notice in the reviews many people mention the stick freezing up, maybe there is a problem with the stick telling the TV's HDMI input that the stick is alive, so to speak."
John Robson,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolutely a PIA to pair, can't get any response ..... so frustrating",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021,"A piece of technology like this should pair straight out of the box, it did not. Since the functioning of the device depends on the pairing of the remote (yes I know there is an app, why doesn't it recognise my Amazon sign in password?) you would expect it to be pre-paired to enable plug and play operation, it was not. Then you would hope that the fundamental task of resetting the pairing would be simple, no it is not, anything but! Following the instructions on Amazons own site did not pair the device, nor did any of the many other web sites instructions. This is so basic and fundamental that a switched on company would make this a simple seamless operation, Amazon I am afraid this is definitely not.  Please rethink, why no simple pairing button or pairing code system? Really, come on, get a grip. All the other functionality may be great but if you can't 'fire up' your Firestick....."

Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five star performance - as expected,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"We're a household that already has an Amazon Echo, several Echo Dots, a Fire tablet and integrated Nest thermostat so we're very familiar with Alexa. Not having the absolute newest TV I went for the Lite version of the Fire TV Stick as I didn't expect the TV to support full control.Pleasantly surprised to find that the Fire Stick can actually turn the TV on and off so all that's missing really is volume control which is no biggie. Also pleasantly surprised to find how easy it is to integrate the Fire Stick with Alexa so almost everything you need to do can be done by talking to the Echo in the room. We haven't explored many of the multitude of apps available yet. We got this item in late November 2020 so we've been binge-watching West Wing on All4 in order to remind ourselves what it's like to have intelligent, capable people in the White House and get up to speed before January. Oh, before I go I should also point out that there's a  very good Android app (other phones are available) so pretty much everything the standard Fire Stick remote can do can be done from your phone.So to sum up: We expected the setup and operation to be really easy and it was. Quality of service is excellent with glitch-free viewing. It integrates well with Alexa and the apps work exactly as they should. Brilliantly simple and simply brilliant."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It’s a right faff, don’t bother",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2020,"Very hard to navigate with so many different apps and subscription channels convoluting it all.I pay for prime video and therefore want easy access to the channels that are included and already covered by my membership/subscription payments. Yet when searching for anything I am always directed to pay per view channels such as Starplayz, which I have absolutely no interest in when I already pay a subscription for prime video.The latest update looks to have tidied things up a little, however I have had to manually reinstate all my user profiles and my child can no longer access his profile at all because “Child profiles are not supported on Fire TV at this time”! Seriously! This is unbelievable! The schools have broken up for the Christmas holidays and my child cannot watch any of his shows or films! Absolutely ridiculous!The other issue I have is with the remote... When using the function ring to skip back and forth, it is far too easy to accidentally press the Home button instead of the Play/Pause button. This may seem an insignificant design flaw, but when you have accidentally hit it and been taken back to the Home Screen to then have to log back into prime video, select your profile and then hunt for the show you were just watching (because it’s not set out very well at all and there is no clear “continue watching” option) for the twentieth time, it becomes rather infuriating and that is when it gets turned off and I switch back to NowTV.So if I were you, just get NowTV and don’t bother with all this faff."
Clementi,2.0 out of 5 stars,Just had SECOND fire stick break,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2021,"Yet again, the Fire Stick has broken.  I’ve used ALL Amazon power sources and connectors (they will tell you to use them if yours breaks),  streaming fine and suddenly just broke.  No real reset despite them giving you rather silly instructions.  And now, the second one has broken.  Amazon say ‘buy another one’ (cheek of it), I say forget it.Seriously, when one broke I thought ‘OK, maybe it’s a one-off’ and bought another, but now the second one has broken.It’s a joke.  Yes, I can use the app, but I pay for channels and you can ONLY receive the channels via the stick.Amazon:  Either make a stick which works for a sensible amount of time, of ensure that ALL of the channels are available on the app.  This is nuts."
J. P. Thompson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bringing a TV into the 21st century !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2021,"This is an easy way to bring an old tv up to date by allowing you to watch all the streaming and catch up services available. I have a LG tv from 2010, so it`s only HD and therefore I didn`t need the Fire 4K version. But this still gives a decent picture on a portable telly. I`ve only installed a few services so far (iPlayer,All4 and Youtube) but that`s plenty to watch for now. It`s easy enogh to set up-just plug it in to the back of the tv and power it up.Then it updates itself and you then add the apps you want. I don`t use Alexa , so can`t say how well it works. But the thing I like most is that I`m in charge of what to watch,so if there`s only rubbish on the main channels I can always find something to watch that I enjoy on Prime or YT."
Soyful Alam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Fire TV Stick Lite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,Purchased this to replace my 2nd Generation Firestick for the bedroom which was a few years old.It’s a lot smaller then my previous Fire TV Stick.The interface is much quicker as well.It doesn’t lose much speed when using Wi-Fi.Only downside is the side loaded Apps do not show the picture in the icon on the Home Screen but this is a minor issue.I still have the 2nd Generation Fire TV box in the living room and they are both running on the Quad Processor.All in all I’m happy with the purchase and I got it for the reduced price of £19.99 which in my opinion is a bargain.I’m waiting for the next Generation Fire TV Box or Cube to upgrade the living room box which is over 5 years old now.5 stars from me.
R-Dodger,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good, very fast.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2020,"Update:-I've had this Lite Fire Stick for a while now and I must say that it is still blazingly fast, far faster than all my other Firesticks, even my 4K stick. It was upgraded to OS 7 some time ago and I like the new UI, but for the price it is far and away the fastest streaming stick I own, the response to button presses on it's remote are near instantaneous. Full disclosure; I do have it hooked up to ethernet via a third party adaptor.This unit replaced a much older iteration of the fire stick and I must say that the difference is like night and day. The fire stick light is so fast at responding to the remote control that I couldn't believe it. The picture quality is very very good. If you don't need the volume controls on the more expensive fire sticks, then get this one."
Chris,4.0 out of 5 stars,Paying Amazon to advertise themselves,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,"Purchased for 2 reasons: 1. To get the UKTVPlay player, as my old TV can't get it, and specifically chose Fire TV Stick, since you can get an Ethernet adapter for it, which I also bought, as it is connected via Powerline Adapters, not Wi-Fi. One can edit which apps are on the main screen, except Amazon ones, so even thought I've not signed up to Prime, I'm stuck with them being continuously pushed in my face. Since Amazon have a credit card associated with my account, I'm scared to use some of its features, in case Amazon goes ahead and charges me for them, without making it clear. Just like they are always trying to trick customers into signing up for a Prime membership Trial. I haven't been able to find the STV player."
Giapetto,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good when it works......,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2020,"Simple enough to install and operate (my Alexa has been banished to a drawer so that's not been part of the experience), but not too stable. I have had to uninstall and reinstall it three times now because of problems. Also the pairing /twinning function I find almost impossible to make work. We really need better user instructions, preferably written on paper."

BPL,1.0 out of 5 stars,A TV stick with great potential but ....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2021,What’s not to like about a convenient TV stick that is easy to set up and you can command with Alexa ease. Well for me it was it’s disappointing picture playback which juddered! Don’t get me wrong it was sharp and appealing but it simply wasn’t smooth! And that got irritating!Now for some you’ll love it for all the apps you get in one place or perhaps you want access to top telly in your mobile home or somewhere where an aerial or set top box just isn’t an option . If that’s you and you have a good WiFi connection then this may be your easy solution as you just plug into a HDMI and a power supply and away you go!!For me however my set top boxes simply out perform it . And I don’t like the rugged playback as it gets irritating as I’m not used to that compromise.So I award this device with potential a 1 star as after poor customer care and a waste of time technical support from Amazon all I have achieved is a lot of wasting time and trip to return it back in the mail .Goodbye Fire 🔥 Stick come visit me again when gasoline is poured over you and you can impress me more!
Baz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing support,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2020,"So after hours of trying to get this thing set up I gave up. First fault find was the plug supplied doesn’t power the Fire stick, used my own and got to the home page then no sound, tried to sort that out but it kept shutting down. So after losing many hours of my life I won’t be getting back thinking I was to blame, I contacted customer support. Jumped through some hoops to come full circle back to the beginning again and no working Fire stick. I was then informed that they will replace the Fire Stick but not the accessories. Mind boggling as the plug is part of the issue (You wouldn’t accept an iPhone that doesn’t let you charge it from an Apple plug) so now I am left with the inconvenience of having to post this junk back to them to get a refund, marvellous."
Lovely,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2020,"Brilliant. I have switched from NowTV to this because they no longer offer vouchers and this is part of my Amazon prime and I already have Netflix so I am not paying for anything extra :) there are certain films etc you have to pay for, however, I won't, it defeats the object of having it! It's fast, the picture quality is brilliant and easy to set up - it just sits in the HDMI port, in the back of the TV and it takes you through the set up, when it is on. So far, so good! Very easy set up. Highly recommended"
Mystery shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Get one for every room,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2021,"I like devices that make me look competent by needing very little actual thinking to operate.  I had this out of its wrapper and installed in about 5 minutes...which is my world record.  I admit I struggled with remembering my Amazon password a bit but that was the hardest part since I always use my favourite swear words for a giggle and unusually had used something non-rude for this site.  Now I have Amazon and, cough, that other movie streaming site in my bedroom as well as the living room and kitchen and I am truly spoiled for entertainment. I watched Dirty Dancing for the 500th time tonight and have Top Gun and The Full Monty on standby.  Lockdown is so much more fun with an Amazon Fire Stick in every room in your house. Get one. Get several."
saxplayer67,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does The Job,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,"My son wanted Disney+ from Father Christmas, so the man in red got him a Fire Stick Lite and left the monthly subs up to me. :)  It was a good idea, otherwise he'd have had to watch it only on his phone, now it can be on our TV.  Picture etc fine, shame the remote doesn't have a power button but you have to fiddle around and get to the sleep option onscreen.Initially plugged the stick into a four way HDMI switcher (after rerouting all plugs, including the stick's, on a trailing extension socket) but it was staticky popping picture and sound, so redid connections, plugged the stick straight into one of the TV's HDMI ports and then routed everything else through the HDMI switcher, to the other HDMI port on the TV and all good.  SO the takeaway is that the stick doesn't like going through anything other than the TV's HDMI port."
richyt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 May 2021,"I have a TV in the kitchen which is out of reach of a satellite or tv aerial connection, so I went for this as a solution. What a brilliant piece of kit. I went for the basic lite version; I don't need it to adjust the tv volume. Once connected to the tv via an hdmi socket, it was easy to connect to my home network. Once it had updated itself with the latest software, it was up and running. It was easy to find my Prime account, so I could carry on watching stuff from there. Access to other streaming services, such as BBC Iplayer and ITV hub just needed the relevant apps downloading. It comes with Alexa, but I don't need this, so just use the handset. Ideal for what I wanted."
Ed,5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, so, so much better than 1st Gen Fire TV Stick",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2021,"We tried the first generation fire tv stick, and it was so painfully slow to start up, or to open apps, that we went back to a Chromecast. This new one is light years ahead. It's still a tiny bit laggy at times, but the new layout makes it really easy to find content - you can watch live tv with TV Player, or with the apps for the channels (which you can't do with a Chromecast), and the voice recognition works well for Amazon content (although it won't work with finding tv programmes in iPlayer for example). Finally it has Alexa built in when you press the mic button, which may be helpful for some people (though we don't make use of it). Good value, especially when on sale."
Steven A. McKay,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stunning value!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"We got our teenage daughter's old TV for our bedroom when she got a new smart TV but it's pretty old, so I suggested getting a new one for us too. Wife didn't really think we needed one, so I got this instead. Wow, for under £20 or whatever it cost, it's fantastic. We have Prime, Netflix and Spotify so this is really everything we need and means we don't have to bother shelling out on a smart TV for a couple of years!I'd highly recommend this to anyone with an older TV looking for an upgrade but maybe not wanting to spend too much or even for grandparents with an older TV in a kids room so they can get Netflix and stuff on it when the kids visit after lockdown!"
Geoff S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Rugby games,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,Really easy to install.  However first pictures of rugby were blurred and kept pausing before jumping on about every second so eventually gave up and watched on digital channel.  Next game much better but last weekend Wales v England it returned kept going away then returning. Will stick with it for final. Let’s hope okEverything else was a great picture do not know why like this for rugby games
Paul-Lancs,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great To Make Old Samsung TV Smart, but..",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"Wrong URL for starters. Amazon.co.uk/code is now /mytvSends an email and then, if that's not good enough, send a link via SMS which doesn't open.Gets to Amazon and wants to change my password. Derr, happy with the secure password I already have. Not happy with that episode of 'let's waste our customers time for longer'.Then, once I phoned India, time expired code.Anyway, finally it was connected *breath again* and it's turned normal Samsung TV into a Smart one. Now I don't lose Smart-ness when my HHD TV Record is recording.Unlike Panasonic, I can uninstall BBC iPlayer. Yay, and now it's out of the way."
George Paterson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does it do as the advert says?  Answer: YES!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2021,"Plugged  it into the power socket and TV, switched to the right HDMI port and, Hey Presto, now have more choices  to select from.  You have to download which extra TV Channel Supplier you would like to access, these I  downloaded from Amazon.  Some are FREE, others you have to purchase.  I already had Amazon Prime (£7.99 per month, and worth every penny) and am ""trialling"" Amazon Music (3 month free trial, if you sign-up after that then a monthly payment of £7.99).  If you are fed-up with the continual repeats of TV shows, films, etc., then this Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite HD streaming device is your saviour.  Recommend it for those who like watching movies or listening to music, far greater choices than standard TV Channels!  The Alexa allows you to SPEAK  your requested choices rather than have to press buttons on the remote, plus has many other facilities you might find useful!  VERY PLEASED with mine!! George Paterson, Senior Gentleman."
Lee Hodson,4.0 out of 5 stars,So Much Better Than Expected,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2021,"My Firestick Lite is plugged into a projector's HDMI port with the USB power cable plugged into an OTG adaptor which is plugged into the projector's USB port. The Firestick works great. I use it for games, music and videos. My only upsets are that there is limited internal storage space and that the user interface could be better organised. With the addition of an external USB drive (via the OTG adaptor) and a gamepad, the Firestick Lite makes quite the home entertainment system.I would buy one of these again. I look forward to trying the next generation of Firestick Lite and hope it includes more RAM and more internal storage."
ziggy1982,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great item,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2020,"Fantastic product. Literally gave my 2013 model of LG smart TV a new lease of life. Since LG gradually removed all apps from the TV overtime, it rendered previously smart TV basically obsolete as only Netflix and Amazon apps were left. Now I can enjoy it all over again. Very happy as the older TV is still in excellent working order and new 4K TVs don’t come with 3D and I own plenty of 3D blu ray discs that I love, so fire stick literally saved it from going into garbage and saved me a pretty penny on buying a new TV. Also, one stick works on both TVs, one in the lounge and the other one in the bedroom. Simply perfect. Bought it only sale for £17.99, even cheaper than during Black Friday."
miss ms,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No tv aerial solution for watching tv and a lot more, brilliant.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Brilliant piece of kit, tv aerial cable broke for the last 10 years, so been relying on old skybox for free view, which is limited and repetitive . And also having to rely on PS4 for other channels. The Firestick has given me more than enough free channels to keep me entertained all night. Love the replay and pause, and uktvplay channel. This is ideal if you haven't got a working tv aerial, all done through WiFi. Would of purchased sooner if I knew it was all received by WiFi. Registering and linking your chosen channel apps to your tv takes time, but once done it’s their forever, no logins after linking, highly recommend. Also you do not have to ask Alexa to view your apps which I do find annoying, you can just use the remote it does it all."
Max,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good image quality,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2021,"The Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite worth every penny. I should buy it earlier. The instruction is clear and easy to understand. After connecting the stick to the TV, just follow the instruction on TV and takes a few minutes to set up. Although it does not come with TV controls, it is not a problem for me at all. My TV is more than 10 years old, the image quality is a high standard, much better than I expected. The only downside is the limited language choices on Alexa voice control.Bought this as a Christmas present at the last minute, arrive promptly before Christmas. I am so impressed with Amazon's service. Thank you."
Steven Spencer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't wait,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2021,"I'm really impressed with this Fire stick lite. I had a second gen which was perfectly usuable but after getting a new Amazon tablet I thought I'd upgrade my fire stick as well.I set it up using the remote control I already had so keeping tv controls.There are little reminders asking me to mention Stream Quality, Voice recognition and Akexa integration. So consider them mentioned. But on make serious note all of these functions are good.As the software is based on android 9 adding extra storage is so simple.So my dumb bedroom tv has gone from dumb to smart to very smart and I'm very happy."
T. Bagge,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s inexpensive and unobtrusive and does its job very well.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2020,"I already have a 1st Generation Firestick, a 2nd Gen Firestick, a Fire TV and a 4K Firestick.The Firestick Lite is the only one with OS7 which means you can, with the aid of an OTG cable, easily supplement its storage with additional USB storage. (You can do this, too, with the Firestick 4K but, because it has got only OS6, it’s more complicated.).The Firestick Lite is very responsive and, particularly as it’s inexpensive, is well worth getting."
Ellie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2021,"I have a relatively old TV now, that doesn't support 4K, so I didn't see the point in paying extra for other firesticks. Plus, this was on a Black Friday deal and the others were sold out. The Lite does the job for me, works perfectly, very user friendly, and I like the fact that it gives you a ton of recommendations across all your downloaded apps in one place on the home screen (similar to what Netflix does). Have had a few connection issues, which I concluded have been down to our internet and not the firestick. My bedroom often gets patchy connection, and since I moved my smart speaker away from my TV, some of the issues have gone - which is one of the troubleshooting ideas that the firestick does suggest with connection issues (moving other wifi devices away).I like the fact that I can move it between TV's effortlessly if anyone wants to watch from certain streaming services - saves connecting the laptop via hdmi!"

Tarquin99,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple to install and use - and very responsive,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"This model doesn't come with TV volume control or other bells and whistles, but is very simple to install and use.  When first connected, it updated the software.  You then select which Apps you wish to install.  If you haven't already got an account (e.g. for BBC iPlayer) you will need to set one up.  It is responsive and with Alexa can be operated by voice.  As my TV is near my router, I bought the ethernet adaptor too, so I could plug it straight into the router rather than use wi-fi.  The stick's power supply then plugs into the adaptor instead of the stick itself.  My primary use is to access BBC iPlayer, though having Youtube and other channels is useful, as is being able to 'cast' from my PC to the TV via the stick.  So far, very pleased."

For £29.99 this is brilliant I can get most of freeview on fire tv. I can also receive lots of other free services. If fire tv is on I can either use voice via remote or control via the remote on my HD8 tablet. I can just say ""Alexa find me a good action film"" to my echo dot, and resulting film choices appear on my fire tv."

To get it to work properly we have to unplug the router, wait about 30s, and then plug it in again. We may have to repeat this after an hour or so of watching a program. I have tried swapping it with the other fire stick in our other TV but the same thing happens. Very odd and a bit annoying."

Clive Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent picture quality, flaky network connectivity.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,"I was so impressed with the performance and picture quality that I decided to buy a 4k version for the living room.Only gripe is that I have to occasionally reboot my router as network throughput degrades over time (not the fault of the firestick). When the network is back, the firestick cannot reconnect to the network even though it detects it and reports it as healthy.The resolution is to restart the firestick via the UI or power reset it via the wall socket.The firmware was recently upgraded to the new UI, I hoped that it would resolve the issue; unfortunately the problem still presents on the upgraded software.This issue does not present on the 4k version."
Mr. John A. Pendry,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the move,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2020,"The instructions are adequate but sparse and you need to do a bit of thinking and experimenting but eventually it all comes together. Picture not quite as good as my Freesat input. I needed to boost the WiFi via an extender and add a converter to add an Ethernet cable, but it was pretty seamless. The remote is a bit flimsy and small and easily lost however it was all worth it for all the extras."
Carl Buckingham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Huge improvement performance over my original Fire Stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2020,"Well worth the upgrade, my original fireTV stick sometimes lagged when scrolling through the home screen or launching apps (Netflix, PrimeVideo, PLEX etc.) but this has vanished with the latest version.I purchased the Lite version as I use a harmony remote to control my other AV devices and therefore there was no need for the TV control. If you have any Harmony remote, or other multi control remote I would opt for the cheaper version."
Shekinah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it you won't regret it.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"I can't really fault this little stick. I had a smart TV in my bedroom and wanted to be able to watch Hay U and amazon prime on a larger screen instead of my tablet. Its absolutely perfect, I'm no IT genius, but to set up is so easy, into a HDMI socket on your TV and USB port and bingo. That's it. My TV defaults to the fire stick and apart from the regular tersiary TV channels which I don't want to watch on that TV anyway,  its fine. I have 2 other TVs in the house with sky plus boxes so in my opinion this firestick would upgrade a very basic TV providing it had a HDMI outlet, to a smart one. Fire is my default now and has everything. Iplayer, youtube, Netflix, plus lots more I don't have time to watch, you get my drift. Best part is I paid £18 just before Christmas. I would recommend strongly, you cant lose."
jonzy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,"After struggling for two years with a chrome cast which I used for my garage tv, I cracked after spending an hour trying to get the thing working. I thought I’d give the fire stick a go. It was as cheap and my expectations were modest. It arrived, dead easy to set up and boy is it a great little product. No more needing to cast from my phone - this product and remote does it all. I can access all my streaming sites easily and quickly and I look forward to going to the garage now for a quick workout. This has to be the best value product I’ve ever bought on Amazon. Brilliant. 6 stars! No downsides at all."
Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,can’t go wrong,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2021,"I don’t normally review products after less than twenty four hours, but I already know this Fire Stick has changed my TV from okay to amazing. I have a Bush Smart TV which is decidedly “okay”. I wanted to add some more apps (like Disney +) ti pimp the TV a bit and a Fire Stick seemed like the best option. Great decision. The quality of the picture is really improved, the number of apps available is huge and my TV works more smoothly than it ever has. If you have a lower end smart TV and want more functionality I don’t think you can really go wrong with this Fire Stick."
Jonny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget friendly fire TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"I purchased one of these for the upstairs TV that doesn't get masses of use, as such we purchased the lite version. The only difference between this and the normal is that there's no volume buttons on the remote.If you don't mind using 2 remotes (one for fire TV and one for volume) this is a good cheaper alterative.Picture quality is still great and voice recognition works well.Slight area of improvement would be the back of the remote where the batteries go. It can be a bit awkward to get off but not a major issue in the grand scale."
Dr D J,3.0 out of 5 stars,Unreliable network connectivity.

Richard,3.0 out of 5 stars,If it worked properly it would be great !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2021,"Had this for a few months now & am disappointed. Extremely temperamental, streaming quality is not great. I bought it for the Eurosport app as BT no longer have ES. Let me save you the bother, don't ! The Eurosport app is terrible, the streaming quality is at best patchy, often unwatchable. Other apps seem ok so I guess its' not the fire stick. However, having recently bought an Amazon ethernet adapter to try to solve picture quality issues, which at first seem to have made a difference, the Fire stick now has a habit of losing connection & freezing up or switching itself to wifi of it's own accord ! Constant unplugging, restarting, which doesn't work, all in all it's very frustrating. If it worked how you'd expect it would be great but most of the time it doesn't. Even had BT engineer out to check my line, router etc & it's all fine. Other devices connected to the same router have no issues. Maybe i'm just unlucky & have a duff one, maybe the Fire stick lite is not as good as the other models, who knows."

It’s reliable and there have been no streaming issues at all, picks up the wifi signal from another floor with ease. I cannot comment on the Alexa integration and voice commands as I feel teaching my mother to do that would be a step too far!

I had been suffering constant drop-outs and buffering combined with too many manual resets when seeing the blank screen instead of the home screen. I had already tried a different broadband router with no improvement so when I saw this lite firestick at £19.99 I thought it was worth a try.  Turns out it is definitely better - quicker responses and, so far after a couple of days trial, no buffering and no blank screen so for me this purchase was a good one and I'll be keeping this firestick."

This new version is far zippier - it's much speedier generally but especially the app load times and, best of all, I'm noticing a much smoother streaming experience with no more lagging or buffering, even though it's located exactly where the previous stick was (I thought I'd maybe need to use an Ethernet connection, but it streams seamlessly without)."
JWF Mcilwraith,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap and Nasty,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2020,"The product Amazon made whilst all their design staff were on holiday. Cheap and badly put together, poor quality plastics  with gaps galore. Reminiscent  of cheap Chinese knock-offs from a decade ago. A typical issue being the utterly pointless 2 inch ""extension cable"". What possible difference could that make to Wi-Fi reception?Amazon advertise this item as having ""Everything you need, right out of the box"", which isn't true as the unit comes with no batteries and with none of the software installed. So be prepared for a trip to the shops and very long wait whilst the tediously slow software installs.Apple TV 100x better than this, my Fire Stick on its way back to Amazon."

Faster and easier to use.I added a 64g Flashdrive (which was not easy to do on the 2nd gen), removed the bloatware and added the apps I wanted onto the flashdrive, keeping the memory usage on the Firestick as low as possible.I force stop every App on closing and delete the cache, it runs like a dream.Bonus was it was only £20 in the Black Friday sale, but would still be worth the full £30 anyway.If you have an older Firestick it is well worth the upgrade and with a few tweaks you will have a beast of a streaming device."
mule4468,5.0 out of 5 stars,Magic wand for TV.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 April 2021,"Overall quality is good, though internet connection dependent.Alexa learns..... As the stick is location based (post/zip code) Alexa can answer local questions ie weather etc.Loads of apps - TV, film etc both on the app store and other sources.Value for money 100%Ideal for upgrading TV to a ""smart"" version and No aerial required, but an hd socket is necessary, so the majority of older TVs, the last 5 yes should be able to use it.Ideal for room with no aerial access.Amazon account is required though."
Brian T,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lot better than earlier versions, but not as good as the more expensive versions",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"Great value for money and works well.Have purchased the Ultra HD and the one with TV controls as wellGiven the choice again, would definitely purchase the one with the TV controls for convivence or the ultra one for a faster response even if only using in HD.Why three? -Simply because the Firestick  gives a simple and consistent interface for streaming on the three TV's in the house replacing the built in ones with different interfaces  for each one  and poorly done to.Life is so much simpler now!"
Paul Woodcraft,5.0 out of 5 stars,Revelation,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 October 2020,"I had an original Fire Stick, which was slowing & struggled to connect to WiFi. I decided to check the new Fire Stick. The Lite version met all my needs as I have a soundbar & didn't need the bells & whistles offered by the more expensive versions.All I can say it is a revelation; its connection is virtually instantaneous when making initial connections to Apps; it just works, which is brilliant."
samantha weiss,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ramble,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2021,"Not yet integrated with Alexa, had it since Christmas, had to turn it off and on again 3 times as it stopped the sound, but that’s no biggie... voice recognition works most of the time, I wish there was a way to totally customise the Home Screen to continue watching being the first to pop up then the suggestions bellow, as I watched a 15 season program I kept having to find where I last was, as it kept sending me to other series of the same show but ahead of where I was...My point... it’s user friendly to someone who is tech oriented, and only ever known this tech... I couldn’t introduce someone tech scared to this... my qualm is more with it being not so user friendly to the minority I guess...perhaps the newer one is better... having it linked to control the tv it’s self like volume etc... I wouldn’t know"
mouseym,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's just okay,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2021,"Bought this to replace my TV's built in smart features, however am returning it for the following;Home screen is a mess, large parts are dedicated to shows i have no interest in whereas the apps i am interested in are hidden away in a small menu denoted by 3 dots.No google play store is another huge problem, amazon's app store is limited, has no search functionality and uses really stupid categories which makes looking for things like a web browser a chore.I have a much better time just connecting my laptop to my TV and using that instead."
Brian E,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2021,I bought it so when I'm away from home I have all my streaming and catch up services conveniently with me without logging in and out temporary accommodation's TV. Plus I got it for £17.99.Set up was easy but I'm quite good with tech.Good points.Pucture quality very good good for 1080p 60Hz on all for example Netflix and YouTube but poor on Sky news but I think it's a Sky issue. Amazon music audio quality is very good to me it sounds close to CD. A few bonuses my TV remote has a some functionality with the firestick and using voice commands it with play radio stations.Not so good points.The body of the firestick has a thickness which on some TV's may make it difficult to plug it into the HDMI fortunately there's a HDMI extender cable supplied for this purpose. Under some conditions when I'm doing something with the TV I lose the sound but the picture is find. I've investigated it and come to the conclusion the firestick stops transmitting the audio. To restore the audio just restart the firestick. I think there Is some incompatibility between the firestick and my Panasonic Smart Viera TV 2012 model TX-L42DT50B. It would be difficult to ensure the firestick was 100% compatible with all past TV's no matter how old they are.Overall I'm pleased with it. A good bit of kit well done Amazon.
Cogs50,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Needs Firmware upgrade, to load none amazon apps via Downloader.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,"The Fire Stick Lite  is Aimed at the novice end of the Market. For someone who want to just plug in and play. If you want to download none amazon apps I would suggest buying the next versions up, 4K or the Alexa tv remote versions.  When loading apps via the downloader, It install the App but there are No Icons, just square boxes with a line through it.  Other than that, the picture & sound quality is very good. A future firmware upgrade may resolve the icon Problem."
W.Spicer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth having,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2021,I bought the device because I've been viewing a lot of Amazon Prime movies and box sets during the pandemic but I've had to watch them on my lap top because my five year old SMART TV was unable to stream them.  The Fire Stick was super-easy to set up: basically plug the device into an HDMI port at the back of the TV plus five minutes of following on-screen instructions. It also works in my small bedroom TV which is not a SMART TV. Just remove the stick from the big TV and plug it into the little one for that to function as a SMART TV. Alexa does work but it's not really a feature that's pertinent to me. I asked it to find Liam Neeson films for me that were free to watch and it lined them all up. Clever stuff.
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple  to use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2021,Didn't buy it for voice control as Alexa doesn't like me. Easy to set up and use. Only downside is there is no off button so you have to leave it on and when you switch it on sometimes it has lost its connection to the internet. I don't know if it is the control itself or the internet. However all you have to do is go to settings and reset and everything comes back exactly as you left it. Not a big deal. It is very small so you have to make sure you put it somewhere you can find it easily or you could lose it down the side of the sofa.
Rachel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2021,"Speaking to a remote? I didn't think I would, but I do. The small remote and easy set up, means this Fire Stick is set up within minutes.Plug the Fire Stick into the TV.Plug the Fire Stick into the mains.Put the batteries into the remote.Select the TV channel.Log in to you WiFi network.Go...There are plenty of apps available, in addition to Prime, so you can use the Fire Stick for BBC, ITV, Channels 4 and 5, plus many more.I would highly recommend."
rodney meek,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dolby Digital Problem,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2020,"Great device BUT DOLBY DIGITAL DOES NOT WORK unless you have the correct equipment,I couldn’t find a correct description or demonstration so I had to try then return.I have a Philips sound bar & Sony TV. It plays Dolby digital plus & 5.1.The fire stick lite would not play DD through my sounbar or TV. Tried every audio settings option.Went back to my older 2019 fire stick & that works perfectly. Dolby digital perfection.So unfortunately the LITE 2020 is no use for me."
Mastwitch Spume,5.0 out of 5 stars,From elderly flat screen TV to smart TV in seconds,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2020,"Had been accessing TV apps by plugging laptop into elderly Sony Bravia flat screen TV, bit of a faff. £20.00 lighter in the wallet I now have a bang up to date smart TV. Fire TV Stick is simplicity itself to use, plug it into the HDMI socket and away you go. I can now access Prime, BBC I Player, ALL4, ITV Hub etc.. Very impressed."
Mr Truth,5.0 out of 5 stars,buy when discounted,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2021,"i only partake in amazon prime when offered as free trial for a month as i dont watch a lot of TV and there isnt much free content that appeals to me but so far i only watched on laptop or firehd tablet so i bought this usb for TV on offer at about £18 i think seeing as i dont subscribe thats fair enough to actually watch on TV . Also what is good though is that even though my JVC smart TV is only a few years old , the iPlayer app in it picture quality seems not that good and i think iPlayer app is actually badly designed  so this Amazon Fire TV stick solves this problem as the quality of all apps is perfect and high res ... personally I dont need 4K .. voice control seems to work but not used that much to be honest...hopefully the youtube and ipayer apps etc will still work when my prime trial ends.... it seems that apps in smart TV's always end up slowing down and dont update so this Firestick hopefully will allow apps to keep up to date ..."
Neil Cartwright,1.0 out of 5 stars,No good for live streams.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2020,"Works great unless you want to watch live sport then it is totally useless. The picture lags, stutters jerks and pixelates. Not just slightly but absolutely massively.This is definitely due to the fire stick as the same programs work perfectly on the iPad connected to the same wireless point. In the end for live sport I have to stream from the iPad to the tv. Just tried watching the rugby highlights and whilst nowhere near as bad as the live stream, there is still jerkiness. Again fine on the iPad."
Hector 52,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs good WiFi to operate properly !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2021,"I have been unable to make proper use of this firestick since I bought it due to the fact that my WiFi internet system via Virgin Media needs to be improved. The programmes that are available via the firestick seems to keep freezing all the time and I am unable to see a complete programme on my kitchen television which operates under ""Freeview"" and is not connected to the Virgin Media System. Once I get the WiFi system sorted out then I believe I will be able to make proper and full use of the firestick."
Lee Fuller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does exactly what one would expect.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2021,"The voice recognition was as per standard with Alexa, the picture quality is limited by the 1080 projector we plugged it into and is very good. The Alexa integration is also fine in that we can watch the ring door bell or ask the usual things one would ask of Alexa. We don’t use it as we have an echo in the room in any case.  We chose this unit due to knowing it would be going into a 1080 device so no need to pay the extra for the 4K likewise we didn’t feel the need to pay extra for TV control as we don’t really use the projectors control so thought it unlikely we would use the function on the fire tv stick remote.  The only negative in buying the is device was realising just how insanely bad our original fire stick (I think it was the first one released) is that we had been using on the projector prior to this, as such we will most likely buy a new stick for the playroom tv and recycle the old one!"
Koyel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great only one flaw which has now resolved,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021,It’s a really good product but for the first few weeks there was an issue when switching over source to the stock there was no sound. To get sound then I would have to unplug from tv and cable to get sounds which was really annoying as everyday I would have to do this if I wanted to use the stick. However the last week this seems to have resolved itself which is ace as this was the only flaw I found. The voice is great and useful when feeling lazy. Stream quality is decent too. Would buy again for sure and do recommend.
awd,2.0 out of 5 stars,Alexa can't control this,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2020,"I have the 4k Firestick and it is controlled by Alexa.I placed this Firestick in a different room group, called it a different name,  yet Alexa cannot contol this one,  even when using the Alexa from the room it is grouped in.  Only if you press the button on the remote will voice contol  work.This leads to a second issue,  if you use the voice search  whist watching Now Tv it causes the app to crash.If anyone at Amazon can explain why Alexa will not work with this and fix it I'll up the mark for the review."
JackieK,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Impressive Streaming Device offering Quality Services and Value for Money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2021,"I have not used a Firestick before and had no prior expectations.  However, it is truly amazing and brings together all the streaming services in one neat location.  It was simple to install and is easy to navigate, plus there are ample videos on Youtube offering guidance and advice to optimise available services and apps.  My only regret is that I did not purchase the Firestick that includes volume control.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this Firestick or similar upgrades to potential purchasers."
Geoff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not compatible with Echo Plus or any Echo,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021,"I didn't read the print properly, this unit as a Lite isn't compatible with any of the Echo products, after plugging into my monitor not TV I realised my monitor didn't have speakers, then tried to connect to my Echo plus, after doing some research I found out that I needed the 4K unit, twice the price but then you get what you pay for, to sum up, if you have a TV  and just want to plug and play then this is the unit for you, if you need to connect to other devices for sound then you need to go for the more expensive unit."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow 🤩 wow 🥳 best piece of electronics ever & for a bargain price 👏🤑,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2021,"Wow this is amazing, so pleased I bought this for my older style TV, it was so easy to install. Just plug & go into the hdmi socket on my telly, then switch to hdmi setting and add my Wi-fi code voila 😃 1 smart tv for the cost of £29.99, I can even access my Bluetooth speaker now and just turn the TV volume down to 0. Thank-you Amazon yet again for saving the day. All the Apps you could think of including Netflix and the remote also works on Alexa so you can voice activate your TV 🥳🥳"
Viktor Stevich,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2021,"5 stars from me.The reason I bought this is that I had apple TV version 3 and they have stopped the ""you tube"" service and they have informed me that they do not support it anymore, it is better for me to buy Apple TV 4.Instead, I bought an amazon fire stick for 1/6 of the apple TV price which literally has much more options than the over expensive apple TV.It is easy to install, easy to use and worse perfect with Alexa ECHO.I am very happy with this purchase"
Webazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Second Firestick which works as expected,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2021,"When you have existing tvs and installations this is such an easy way to get netflix, amazon prime etc.  It is our second firestick and they both work really well.Getting Amazon Music to realise not to play on the alexa is a challenge!  But it all works very reliably otherwise.If there was a niggle it would be with the app writers rather than Amazon Firestick itself.  E.g.Sky news - used all the time - but no pause facility (useful when the calls come inBBC iPlayer - increasingly less reliable app - programmes (e.g. news) take ages before they are available and the app often crashesDeezer - simply not an option if you use Amazon firestick because it times out after 20 mins or so.  Really poor implementationAmazon Prime - difficult to navigate and remember what you are part way through watching compared with Netflix which has this facility sorted perfectly.Amazon Music - really not anywhere near as well organised as Deezer or Spotify but given they are a newer entrant it works well and we do use it (because Deezer is useless on Firesticks)I am rambling but the bluetooth connection on Firestick Lite HD works really well for connecting to BT headphones or most speakers - but it does not fall back to 2.1 in full stereo properly if you want to connect to BT PA equipment which tends to use older BT standards.  The older Firsetick does work properly.Having said all this it is amazing value for money and does pretty much all you need very reliably and neatly."
Mr J.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Remotes construction is only negative.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2021,"The missus was a slave to costly TV subscriptions and 'the planner' whether it was Sky, EE, Virgin or BT - having the schedule and reminders was a must have - we solved this with a firestick and a radio times subscription. I opted for this version as I thought an extra 10 bucks for a 'tv volume control button' was a bit steep however that is my only regret, within 10 minutes I wished I had that button. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this sticks performance, worked straight out of the box already linked to my account. So why the 4 stars? it loses a star as the battery cover isn't as tight as can be and squeaks whilst using it, feeling slightly cheap."
Mr. G. Webb,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great little device that has exceeded my expectations,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"Really simple to setup after an initial glitch trying to connect to my WiFi. In fact it was mildly alarming just how much Amazon managed to preconfigure with all the data it has stashed away on me already! I'm using this to feed into a 1080p apeman projector I recently picked up, far easier than routing great long cables about. The device itself is very easy to use, and the interface is great. For less than £20 this is a fantastic bit of kit and I'm really pleased with it."
Paul,5.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality RC BUT the Firestick is great.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2020,The RC only gets 3 stars because of quality. Compared to the 2nd Gen firestick this one is more flimsy. We notice that when we go to pause a movie or whatever the RC flexes in your hand. As this was an upgrade from our 2nd Gen firestick (I gave that one to my mum) there really is a feeling of less rigidity Andover quality. A shame. We also have the 4K Firestick and it's RC is definitely made better.The lite Firestick itself is great and does what it says on the tin.
happy puppy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,"Used this to update a non smart Panasonic plasma TV.  It works well does everything i so far need it to do.  I've only rated the video quality as 4 stars as I've not tested it at anything other than 720p which it does well. So I cannot comment on higher resolutions.  Not found I needed the volume controls on the remote, as you can adjust it with the TV remote. Alex as always struggles with ascents, unless East-ender-Essex. and really struggles with received pronunciation."
Margaret,1.0 out of 5 stars,JUST A BLANK SCREEN!!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2021,"I was happily using my Firestick for normal streaming, watching The Crown and Friends on Netflix, when all of a sudden one time the screen was blank, and none of the remote buttons could change that!! All I had was a voice-activation function - nothing else! I eventually got the voice to show me Netflix, but when the programme was over, it didn’t return to normal, it just went back to the black screen! And now even the voice won’t work!  Can anyone help? Most advice online involves going in to Settings, but I can’t do that as there’s nothing at all on my screen, so nothing to navigate to, and no means of navigating!I’ve only had it for about a month.  Hoping someone sees this and can help me!"
A. R.W,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brings an old TV back to life for streaming channels,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 March 2021,"My 10 year old TV has plenty of HDMI sockets but very limited internet capability. The Fire TV Stick Lite has opened up a huge amount of content. To date just using for Prime, BBC, ITV, Channel 4 catchup services.  Watching videos on YouTube it seems that it can be configured to connect to a lot more content, that's something for a rainy day. At the moment just content in watching movies on Prime and deciding on whether I really need a TV license any more if all I plan on watching is catch-up and no BBC iPlayer content."
Lisa,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, perfect streaming and clear picture",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020,"I had the original Amazon Fire Stick but it started lagging and crashing a lot when I was watching videos. This newer Fire Stick is so much more superior. It set itself up in minutes using the Wifi info from my previous stick so I didn’t have to Put the passwords in again. It is also far far faster, with no lag and the picture quality is a lot better. I’m still getting used to the Voice activated function on it but it’s fun to try it. I wish I’d Upgrades ages ago."
Fir3mansam123,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bargain powerful streaming device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"Excellent upgrade to my 1st generation stick which was slow laggy and very unresponsive.This one is quick load up on playing no buffer wait and is responsive.Also unlike my 1st gen, you can add external storage and ethernet connection if you wish to which makes it a fully functional media centre.I don't have a 4k TV so this is perfect for me.And best of all its currently only £19.99 £10 cheaper than the normal price."
Sof,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple to install and use, and inexpensice",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2021,"I bought this after a complete fail at getting a Google Chromecast to work. How different this was. Installed it in an HDMI port on the side of my TV, easily connected to passworded wifi, no faffing with a phone (which is required with the Chromecast). Just a simple little remote control that needs little learning to operate. You press a button to speak commands, so you don't feel listened to all the time.Once you've logged in on set up to all your favourite servies (mine are Netflix, iPlayer, BBC Sounds, YouTube, Amazon Prime, etc), you can ask it to play or continue something via a simple voice command and it finds it on whatever service, so you don't have to remember which service it was on.An extra feature I would like is a list of what I've recently been watching on any streaming services. This does not yet appear to be available, only within them."
katy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great gadget,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021,"Loved the fact this time it asked if I wanted to download or sync my previously purchased apps so I didn’t have to do each one individually again. This is my 4th firestick, they keep breaking, I’ve got a tv that goes up and down in the bed and the lead keeps getting caught up so have had to keep replacing them. I couldn’t be without one, my make of tv, although a smart tv you can only have the apps they have, had no idea when I purchased it that there was such a poor choice"
Terri webb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well without having to buy a smart tv,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2020,"Great little product, bought for the spare tv instead of buying a smart tv. Downloaded tv player so has normal freeview and works fine on iplayer ect. Our main amzon dot controls it well if we want it to Or can use alexa on the remote.

Chester,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for money.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2021,"Excellent addition. I mainly bought it to have UFC fight pass on my TV, but having all of the extra and staple entertainment apps really helps.It’s easy to set up and its a convenient size so you can easily plug it into any TV with a HDMI and USB port. I use it in both TVs in my house (24in & 55in) and the quality is great on both.I would recommend to anyone who wants to have and updated smart TV experience without having to buy a new TV."
Josh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very small and very capable little device!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2021,"They really are great little devices its a shock how they offer them for so cheap cause there better than any streaming box ive had and its just unreal how small and capable they are, i have my prime video and alexa and amazon music all on there ready to use and downloaded netflix and youtube and some cool apps such as vlc player so i can watch my movies on theres also some great free games like beach buggy racing and crossy roads that my son loves. Theres also hangman/ picture quiz, and gta3/vice city avalable for 2.99 each! but id stress you get a cheap 4gb usb drive or somethin to send your apps to, you will also need an otg cable to be able to connect it cause any of the gtas will use every bit of space up on the firestick lite. Just cant believe ive waitin so long to get one im quite into tech and a big gamer this device really has impressed me especially for its price point 29.99!  would highly reccomend a firestick for anyones house. Now a prime member, a firestick user, an alexa user, and i even have the lightbulb! what next?"
David W,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fast Wi-Fi and apps boot up very quickly.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2021,"It took a while to get the product set up. The Panasonic TV port kept timing out and I did not get to finish typing in a password. Eventually set yup the system on a basic system with no timeout.Good Wi-Fi capability. Boots up apps very quickly.Now works fine on the Panasonic. So in all a good product that will replace some of the older ""smart"" items we have with power Wi-Fi and processing power.We do not have Alexa.Recommended."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job - very well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2021,"Bought this firestick to replaced an older one that was grinding to a halt as a result of updates I suspect it was never designed to process - but kept running all the same. The comparison is night and day, the new firestick is much faster in operation, the streaming is excellent and the picture upscaling noticeable, the audio too seems to be improved. I had intended to wait until the 'new generation' standard firestick came down in price but why bother when the 'Lite' version so convincingly covers all the bases. Money well spent, would highly recommend."
Ms. M. Leask,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Fire Stick Lite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 April 2021,"This new Fire Stick is working very well with no problems whatsoever.  Not being able to control the tv with it does not present any difficulty.  It was time consuming to have to register with BBC I Player, Netflix, STV etc. all over again.  I thought it would just carry on where my previous Fire stick left off but that is really just a minor detail.  As long as it keeps working as well as it is at present I shall be very happy with my purchase."
Stephen J Bannister,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fire Stick Lite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2021,"Excellent value for money, my partner and I have cancelled our subscription  TV package and just gone with prime, there is a lot more on there than you would think! Combined with some other apps, it has everything you need!However, frustratingly it doesn't seem to work occasionally. There is no way to close the system down aside from putting it to ""sleep"", and often I find the next time I use it I need to unplug it from the wall and plug it back in again, which is super inconvenient to climb around the back of my setup. Other than this, excellent value and not the worst thing to have to do for a workaround."
Matt Walker-Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very easy to set up.  And oces et up, it works like a dream.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,"Easy access to our Netflix, account. Plus iPlayer, ITV Hub and Channel 4. And YouTube for all he exercise videos.  Amazon Music is a revelation.  Never even realised there was such a thing. And easy to use.  Press the ""mic"" button on the remote, say ""play Barry White""  and bingo - endless Barry White playlists. Would be absolutely brilliant for blind people or people with other limitations.  We don't have an Alexa dot or echo, so can't tell you how that work.  The voice command recognition built into the Firestick, works very well with our ordinary English (Northern and London) accents."
Becky Rose,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2021,"Since cancelling Sky TV, we were looking for a device which would allow us to watch catch-up tv on our 2014 Panasonic - although it is still a great TV, it doesn't have as many smart features as the newer models. This Fire Stick is great for that - it's lightweight, the picture and sound are brilliant (arguably better than Sky) and crucially it's easier to use. Love the fact that all of our apps are integrated (Disney+/Netflix). Very good value!"

I just wanted something cheap to play games via Moonlight Game Streaming, with the occasional bit of YouTube, twitch, etc. I don't really watch 'tv' a whole lot.The latency could be better for Moonlight; I plan to get an ethernet adapter later and see if that helps. Besides that, it's perfect for what I need."
Anita W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,really good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,"i mainly bought this firestick for my 3 grandkids to use so they don't use my 4k firestick lol... and i'm very impressed with it...but i really do think Amazon needs to do something about a game controller....alot of amazon games require a game controller, which amazon now have no official one available...but a few times i've gone on chat and asked for advice on a compatible one and been given different answers, and twitter as given a different answer too. This really isn't good enough, amazon sells 1000's of the firesticks, cubes etc so surely a tried and tested list for customers isn't too much to ask....who can afford a £40 game controller that only ""might"" work... well i've bit the bullet and send for a game controller for my grandkids and just hope it works...."
Adzmaz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Play good, connect poor",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2021,"While the stick itself when working is quite good, it has room for improvement.When I have used it and put it in sleep mode, I'll come back and it will say no signal, which then means 20 minutes of testing signal, signal saying full signal but still wont connect, then you have to re start the stick again, then eventually it will connect.Also certain apps aren't available which is poor.Not connected to alexa or used voice recognition."
Jekaterina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great device!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021,"Amazing device.  100% recommended from me. I have TV that is 9 years old. It still work perfectly but not smart TV. So I have used my laptop with TV to watch Netflix and amazon prime video. But after I've got fire stick I no need my laptop anymore near TV. Now my not smart TV works like a smart TV. Fire stick have YouTube, Internet browser, Netflix, amazon prime video, that is everything I need to have on my TV. Fire stick very small and save me a lot of space near TV. I followed guide which I've got in box to install everything and it takes me 5-10 minutes.I'm love that device have parental control, so I'm sure that my kids watching only what they allowed.Very easy to use, remote is very small and no need space for another huge remote.I'm love it."

The hdmi adaptor makes life so much easier as i cant get the cable in the back of tv without struggling due to arthritus .  Very happy to have access to Netflix can now watch Free Rein which helps in lockdown due to not going out much , and Lark rise to candleford series vampire diaries etc etc on Prime video which are also paid for already! watched Free Rein season one and onto the Waltons at the moment ,im thick at technology this was easy to sort . only moan is that it rejected my working password for my e mail address and keeps doing that but that was soon sorted out  .Fine for rest of lockdown able to have a screen break as small screens giving me a headache ! very happy and would recommend as a good purchase ."

CB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for access to apps on your TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2021,"I bought this to get apps like BBC iPlayer and Netflix on my non-smart TV. It's really simple to set up (takes a matter of minutes) and download the apps you want. Streaming is fast, which is an improvement on the previous version which was buggy and slow. I'm very happy with this purchase and the novelty of the voice recognition is still quite fun. The remote doesn't have volume control but this doesn't really matter to me. The device plugs into the back of my TV in the HDMI port easily, although there is also an extender provided if plug-in space is an issue. The range of apps is excellent and it is easy to rearrange or delete them."
Stevie G,5.0 out of 5 stars,This stick has fire-d me up!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,I bought this stick primarily to receive Apple TV on my TV. I was sceptical if it would do this and was ready to send it back it it didn't. I was very pleased to see that it worked and that it worked really well. It was a breeze to set up and navigate through. The picture quality is true HD and Alexa works well. I can't think of anything negative to say about it. I bought it when it was on offer so it's even more value for money!
Margaret Chm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good device if you already have Prime,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"Bought this in order to watch rugby as Amazon got rights to Autumn Nations Cup. We have family Prime membership which means no extra expenditure, otherwise wouldn’t have bought it. I have most of the TV I want, but may well use it to watch films that I can’t get elsewhere. Setting up was very easy and picture quality generally good though some breaks in streaming, though that may be our broadband. Shan’t use Alexa, so can’t comment on that."
pgo,4.0 out of 5 stars,Why bother with Alexa?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 December 2020,"I had to return a Roku Stick (useless). What I wanted was BBC iPlayer and the streaming services from ITV and Channels 4 and 5 (for a 10 year old Sony TV). And that is what I've got. It was easy to set up and I am content. Far fewer apps than Roku (and some looked promising), but they were all Yank ... and that means a lot of rubbish.Yes. I recommend the Fire Stick lite. But I really don't need Alexa ... Amazon's 'spy'."
Rob Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hiccup on installation update but got there in the end,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,"Upgraded from a first gen Firestick as needed a second and the price reduction in November seemed well worth taking advantage of.  Installation was trickier than anticipated as encountered error code 8056 which prevented streaming live sport.  It's an updating error and therefore 4 instead of 5 stars for this review.  I found that a factory reset was needed and, for me, the update seemed to hang at about 80% through but eventually (waiting 20 minutes) it completed and this sorted it all out.  The voice control through Alexa is very good, reducing time to navigate around the apps and searching for programmes."
David R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Replces my Smart hub,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2021,"I didn't realise what a Fire TV stick actually did in spite of the adverts. When I had trouble with the smart hub on my eight-year-old TV being so slow, not able to display streamed broadcasts, and failed to have a YouTube app, I was advised by a family member to get a Fire TV stick. I should have done it ages ago because now I have a complete replacement for my built-in smart hub so I don't need to buy a new television set."
Joanne,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fire stick okay,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2021,"This was on offer (£20) so we thought yeah why not give it a go.  Only problems - Always seems to be a synchronisation problem with sound and video - sound is often a few seconds behind pictures... only seems to happen when watching things with the fire stick. On iPad, phone etc all is synched.  It’s weird, sometimes sorted by ff or rwd.  But using Alexa to search is great - amusing at times too - we put this down to hubby’s regional accent!"
CJAD93,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, few minor issues",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2021,"So far I've really enjoyed my fire stick. Has a great range of apps and content. It's cheap, does a good job. Issues I have with mine are:1. When put into sleep mode I cannot turn the fire stick back on with the remote, I have to completely switch it off at the wall and back on.2. A sleep timer on the device would be really helpful, I have mine on at night whilr falling asleep, so having no sleep timer is a bit disappointing.Other than theres 2 issues which are both power related I really enjoy my fire stick."
frostar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bargain,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2021,"I got this as a backup stick during Black Friday discounts - was a steal . . .It has all the functionality of the previous Firestick but with latest processor and memory, more of a Standard Stick than a Lite version!!  If like me you don't require basic TV controls on the remote why pay the extra for that?  I question the requirement for a 4K version, as who has a 4k TV that isn't a Smart TV with Amazon already on it?A slightly worry thing is that the new stick logged on to my WIFI without the need to enter the security code because I already had a Firestick . . .  a hackers paradise??"
Ms Beeby,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what I wanted to do minimum fuss,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2020,"Plugged this into a HDMI port using the handy extender. Simple set up to follow didnt have to put in passwords as already have alexa in situ.  Wanted this to use Amazon prime as no ariel in my bedroom and just wanted to watch as unwell.  Worked really well good picture, you can add other apps such as BBC Iplayer or Netflix etc but with additional cost ...didnt bother although did add my amazon music.  Did what I wanted. Turns any TV into smart TV"
O,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says on the tin,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021,"Other than the power supply issue.. this product is great for the price and basically makes your non-smart TV ‘smart’. Alexa’s voice recognition is the most seamless of the lot; although of course the Fire Stick can’t substitute for an Echo.Would be nice for a product that could combine both. A smart speaker and a streaming device. Not sure if there is already such a device and I’m just ignorant. Possibly Apple TV but that’s much pricier; Siri is no match for Alexa.The ‘power supply issue’ is the fiddly-ness of having to run a usb power cable to the stick when it’s plugged into a HDMI port (even with the extension).Of course there is the dongle that draws power from another USB port on your TV (if available). But this adds to the cost and more important is still fiddly! Two ports used up and still messy cables, albeit shorter.Does HDMI not allow sufficient power to be drawn from the HDMI port itself? If not they should consider that; of course I guess that would make it more a competitor to USB (data port) than an audio/visual port. Which I suppose is not something the relevant authorities want to pursue...Anyway.. if you have a ‘dumb’ TV - this product is top-notch."
bevlah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Value for money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2021,"I bought the Firestick on a whim after reading a few reviews and have to say I'm really pleased with it.  I was a bit apprehensive it wouldn't work as I got it for my TV in bedroom and Internet connection is a bit hit and miss in there.  But it's absolutely brilliant.  Super easy to set up,  works a treat.  I only really got it to watch Amazon movies in bed but I know it can do so much more that I've yet to discover.  Great little device for £17 !"
corinne morgan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"Really pleased with the Amazon lite, bought it for my grandson, he has a TV in his room that he never used much, now he enjoys watching you tube, and prime videos which we got on trial and purchase monthly now, as there are so many benefits to having the subscription. The voice recognition works a treat, and it is easy to navigate around the menu, yes some channels you do have to subscribe, however really pleased with this product, you get a lot of value and use, it even comes with battery's and its own adapter to fit most TV,s which is a plus, easy to set up, one of the best things I have bought."
E B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"New screen layout, great picture quality.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"This fire stick has a new format on screen and the new layout is much better than my 6 year old fire stick (which this is replacing).As ever fast delivery and worked straight out of the box, even recognising my wifi from my Amazon fire tv account. The picture quality is excellent and the selection from app to app on the remote is very quick and smooth. This new fire stick is a massive improvement on my old one."
MOJOTAMWO,5.0 out of 5 stars,Upgrades a “Non-Smart” TV.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2021,"I bought the Fire Stick to allow me to watch Netflix & Prime on a old non-smart TV. This has been totally successful and has also unexpectedly added many more obscure “free” channels. Installation and set up is relatively easy. A short cable is included in the box that enables the stick to hang down rather than protrude straight out of the back of the TV.  Switching from Terrestrial and Satellite TV services  to Fire is slightly complicated, but is a minor inconvenience for the benefits gained.  It’s too soon in my ownership to make any comments about the product’s longevity but, apart from that, I would 100% recommend this product."
Kenny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good upgrade on original Firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 October 2020,Had an original firestick for years but it was becoming increasingly slow and had minimal memory. Got the new one as I have recently moved house and this is great. Easy to set up and add the apps I had on my old device plus a few more as bigger storage. Decided to get the lite version as the additional £10 for the other model just let’s you turn you TV on/off and adjust volume but I already have the TV remote that does that!
W. Peter Graham,5.0 out of 5 stars,A source of limitless entertainment and information,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021,"I was experiencing some difficulty in accessing iPlayer and other services, until I discovered that they were no longer available on my 7 year old Sony TV.One of my family recommended the Firestick and I duly ordered one and it was available for collection within 48 hours.The Fire TV Stick Lite with Alexa Voice Remote Lite arrived with clear and easy to understand instructions on installation.  It can take some time to register with the various streaming services available, but this has only to be done once and future connections are very straightforward.The Alexa feature has already proved useful, bringing up a movie from 1992 which I wished to view."
jacqueline mason,5.0 out of 5 stars,Its a great addition to any TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2020,"Easy to install and comes with Alexa voice control for when your feeling lazy just say the film name and it will come up if it is available. You can add any apps you want. You can login to any accounts you have already like Netflix, Amazon Prime etc but your tv will need more than one HDMI port if you have Sky or anything already using your HDMI port/s. It works a treat."
Chuckdoodles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2021,"I had been so fed up with my Samsung Smart TV interface. It was laggy and slow to respond. I was at a mates house and he has a fire stick and was seamlessly zipping through his various streaming apps. So I decided to get the fire stick lite, and it's amazing. It was a bit of a pain to have to log into all my apps again but once that's done its fantastic. Voice search works well, especially when I've had a glass of wine or 2 and decide to call out random music videos to play on YouTube. It's so simple, fast and effective. I'm very happy."
J. Roberts,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to install and use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2021,"I replaced an older version of my Fire Stick with this one.  Looked carefully at the other versions but didn't need extras (eg volume). Out of the box and installed in minutes.  Works every time, my old version is now working great upstairs but didn't downstairs nearer to the hub.I have used Alexa a couple of times successfully.  I haven't yet really delved into the this new fire stick.  I've got standard stuff loaded and happy with that.  I am now able to get you tube making me necessary exercises better than on my smart phone!"
D. Daniels,5.0 out of 5 stars,A good product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021,It was easy to initially set up the fire stick. I did not find it so easy to set up BBC I player or the ITV hub. In fact I still haven’t got the ITV hub working. After three weeks of really enjoying catching up on BBC programs the fire stick refused to find ‘home’. Switching off at the mains seemed to restore functionality. I will be happy once I have got ITV hub working. Impressed with the voice control.
Kerry Thomson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super quick delivery,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2020,"Having been begged to buy Disney bloody plus I was very annoyed and disappointed to find that if you have a Panasonic TV it wont work. Also, you may have Sky but you have to have Sky Plus, if you don't you cant have it either!!! So having spoken to the nice man who sold me the Panasonic TV's I was advised to buy a fire stick. All the technology is not making my life easier! Another drama I could live without!"
Susan Montgomerie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple catch up tv for old TVs,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2020,"As a complete novice to voice control and catch-up tv, it was relatively easy to install and sign up to all the apps. My 12 year old “dumb” tv now has bbc iPlayer, all4, my5, STV player, itv hub, YouTube, uktv play, all free streaming services. So, new telly, for a small price! The picture quality is good considering the age of the tv and the remote control is simple to use. All in all, I’m very happy with this purchase."
Sassoon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Suprisingly a small device that does a lot at a very good quality.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2021,"I bought this device as a second streaming device for my bedroom for my non-smart tv. It changed the watching experience to a totally new level. It has all the main streaming options such as Netflix, Disney, BBC, and a lot more. The Amazon streaming is also great. Some apps need to be downloaded before use. The quality of the streaming is great. I would highly recommend this device even if you have a smart tv, it is so easy to use."
Miss Kitty,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive piece of kit!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2020,I have a chronic illness and spend a lot of time in or on my bed. I have amazon unlimited music on my phone but wanted to have it on my tv. After doing a bit of research I found this and I’m really happy with it. Set up was easy as you’re given all the steps to follow on your screen. Now listening to Duran Duran via my fire stick and very happy!!Very cheap for an impressive piece of kit. I’d certainly recommend.
Dan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Turned my dumb TV into a Smart TV!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 March 2021,"After having issues streaming on an old LG smart TV we decided to get a Fire TV stick. Straight out of the box, it was easy to set up and the stream quality was superb. You can boost the strength of the receiver if you need to with an attachment that is included. It’s easy to set up your Netflix account, Spotify and other subscription services as well as BBC iplayer and so forth. For the price, it is superb and the remote is compact, robust and easy to use. It has proved to be an inexpensive and functional upgrade to our otherwise perfectly functional TV."
LYNDA K,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good streaming device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2021,"Bought this as a replacement for my 3 year old Fire TV stick which stopped working. Easy and fast setup. I don't use voice control a lot but it seems to work well, The new Fire stick can get Brit box, Apple TV and Discovery+ apps which my smart TV doesn't have. The apps load much faster and better home screen layout on the new device. The only annoyance sometimes is when launching Discovery+, often it doesn't load - just get a blank grey screen but going through the settings menu to 'restart device' does the trick."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good upgrade,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2021,Was not sure about this release but now having had it for a while can honestly say impressed with this firestick. Performs just as as well my 4k firestick but obviously only in 1080p but as this was for upstairs so not a problem.Anybody wanting to upgrade from the old 2nd gen firestick highly recommended.Just waiting for amazon to release a new 4k firestick but to be honest my 4k firestick has served me well for for a few years now.You cannot go wrong with firesticks love em.
Claire,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much improved and user friendly,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,"Purchased this to replace my old one and I’m very happy with it. The home layout is much easier to use and looks good too which is a bonus. Alexa can still get a bit confused bless her, I think that’s probably to be expected seeing as this is a fire stick and not an actual home hub. Speed of actions is great although this may depend on your internet connection I guess. Overall it’s pretty perfect. No volume controls for tv on this fire stick which I prefer, there is a more expensive version with tv volume control, I just didn’t see the point."
Mr John Ryder,1.0 out of 5 stars,Screensaver does not really function properly,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2021,"I bought this so that I could use the screensaver function on shuffle, and access all my photos stored on the Amazon Photos App. As the screen kept going black after a short time, repeated (7 or 8) discussions with Amazon helpline technical experts could not solve the problem, until one more knowledgeable guy finally admitted that the screen saver had a built-in function that switched to sleep mode after 14 minutes, and there was nothing I could do about it. This was after all the advice I took from experts with Amazon and Currys to the contrary.So, if you want to use it to look at random photos, don't waste your money."
S. P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Amazing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2020,"This is so straightforward, so easy to set up.

Dee Cee 1970,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant upgrade on my existing Fire stick..,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2021,"This was an upgrade on my existing Fire stick and it doesn't disappoint.Set up was quick and easy and it automatically loaded my existing apps.This model connects much faster than my basic model and streaming is smooth.This is actually my first Alexa product and so far, she has selected what I've requested first time and made sensible choices for my other less specific searches.I'd definitely recommend this upgrade if you're still using the basic Fire stick and it's really well priced."
Lemonhunny,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you don't have on, get one!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2021,"Frankly, it's quite possibly the best investment I've made as regards TV!I've had Netflix & Disney+, but the Firestick is giving me all the TV shows I didn't see first time round, plus following a soap from the 80's which I remember watching back then.My only regret is that I didn't get the Firestick in March2020 when my business was shut for 3 months and we were in Lockdown 1!"
Mr. R. Burton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better for streaming than many ""Smart"" TV's",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2021,"The unit does what it says. A little setting up is required for each service (the usual User Name Password etc.). Once this is done it is easy and simple to use, controls (pause, fast forward rewind) work well. The voice search feature is effective. The unit does try to upsell streaming services if you don't go straight to your chosen catch up channel, but subscription services are well flagged."
Lizzy,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,"I love this .I can watch live TV and you tube which is the main reason I bought this BUT it's SO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT.  I can just say ALEXA please find me x on you tube and its found so easily.  Its particularly great because I am not very techno and it saves me the trouble of trying to find it myself, PLUS I bought this in tne sale so it was only £19.99. Big win as far as I'm concerned Thank you ."
Nippier,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for streaming,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2020,I really love this product bought mainly because the BBC I Player was taken off my TV.  I managed to fit it myself and am getting used to the different facilities it gives.  There is absolutely nothing to dislike about it and I would recommend it to anyone. It has given me much more than just the BBC I Player and I am gradually discovering different videos to watch.  An excellent Amazon product.
CazzyBuy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I don't use Alexa but you do not have to with this at all...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2021,I was worried that this may need for me to use Alexa - I looked up in forums and I was almost sure I would be okay so ordered it.  I was pleased it did not ask or require me to use with Alexa installed as I do not use that.  It works fine and was easy to install.  This was my first upgrade from the original version  bought back in the day and thought the newer version be better than that now.
Sheene1976,4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have Sky Q, don't bother",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"Bought it to watch the Autum nations rugby as my Sharp TV app was hopeless. Plugged it in along with the separate power supply (once fully charged) and worked straight away. Juddered a couple of times but once I dropped the screen resolution, it worked spot onHowever, as the title suggests, if you have Sky Q you don't need to buy this as it's now one of the apps on the homescreen."
Wendy B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2021,Was sent the Firestick by Racing TV as they no longer supporting the television channel on Freeview.  This now means that I can still watching the racing on my television via their app rather than casting it from my phone. Overall really pleased.  Easy to install the via stick on the television.  The app works well and the picture quality is very good.  Alexa is very responsive.  And my daughters are happy as they have been able to upload their Spotify accounts as well.  YouTube also works on it really well too.  Highly recommend it especially if you haven't got a smart  tv.
TWM,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not purchase this sub standard product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2021,"This is an extremely poor product that does not function properly. Sometimes it works, mostly it doesn't. It can rarely find the  home page and seems to default to Netflix or BBC i player. It was purchased  specifically  for catch up tv and fails miserably. To make things worse a message appears advising to contact Amazon Customer Services. If anyone can tell me how to achieve this I would be grateful. Having submitted  the above review Amazon made contact. The product was returned to factory settings, all apps were lost and had to be reinstated ( which took an hour ) and everything worked for 24 hours.  Amazon said they would ring back in 3 days to check progress, but that didn't happen.  I am now back where I started with a useless product. This is amongst the worst items I have ever purchased anywhere.  Do not purchase this product under any circumstances."

Ray Blureview,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stream with ease,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,Although I have smart access on my devices none supported Disney Plus which is why I bought this device.  The overall quality and ease of use make this a stunning addition to anyone's media setup.  The picture quality is exceptional plugged into my surround amplifier and projected onto a large screen.  The voice control works faultlessly.  I have no hesitation in reccomending this product.

I would buy again and I would recommend it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2021,Before I purchased this I asked the question does it have Apple TV as that was the main reason for purchase and two people said no and 2 said yes ....so I took the gamble !!!Let me assure all those wanting to know the same question that it definitely DOES have Apple TV as you can see from my picture and also NOW TVIt’s easy to use and was delivered quickly and works with my Alexa too!!
Dr R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall improvement over the 1st generation, but Dolby Digital passthrough needs to be fixed",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2021,"I bought this as a replacement for a 1st generation Fire TV Stick, which had become progressively slower over time. The new version is much quicker than the old one and generally performs very well. Setup is quick and simple and the new interface is intuitive.On the down-side. Dolby Digital passthrough simply doesn't work. The option is available, but all that comes through is standard PCM stereo. This is something of a disappointment, seeing as the first generation stick managed this without a problem. I suspect this is a software problem, since the option is available to be selected; it just doesn't do anything. I've tried talking to Amazon customer service, who took me through all of the obvious stuff, to no avail. I've asked for it to be raised with the developers, but I've no idea if this has been taken forward or not. I've seen several others with this issue as well, so it's not an isolated case.So, overall it's a good device, and if 5.1 Dolby Digital isn't an issue for you, go right ahead, otherwise you might want to wait or look elsewhere."
ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"Bought this as our old Firestick was really slow and clunky, not being sure whether it was our broadband that was the problem (or not) took a chance and bought this updated version. It works a treat. Usual easy set up and bingo fast connection , no buffering etc. Haven't bothered with the Alexa connection or voice activation just pleased to have a solid service. Don't hesitate, buy it !!"
Binky,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not perfect,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2021,"Good but has a glitch most days. Sometime it freezes (just a case of taking the batteries out of the remote and putting them back in).IPlayer seems to buffer more than the IPlayer app on my Smart TV and I’ve noticed that on some channel 4 on demand programs it goes to a commercial break abd then back to the beginning of the program. Again, not a problem I’ve had with  my smart TV.I am pleased I bought it despite the glitches."
Daniel Leeman,4.0 out of 5 stars,Firestick provides an excellent expandable portal.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2021,"The Firestick was a Christmas present to provide improved streaming to my projector which it certainly does. I can access Programmes either through the remote or our home Alexa echo. Picture and sound quality are excellent. I’ve recently been using it on our TV and, like a number of people, have noticed that it can interfere with terrestrial reception. The easiest solution to this problem is to switch the Firestick to Sleep mode or switch it off. Apart from that it would have earned a 5 star rating."
Angelsoft,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is faster, neater, a much better product all round.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2021,"So I told myself that I didn’t need a new fire stick, given that I already had an original.Then, in a fit of, I don’t know, Communist controlled insanity? I bought the new one.This is faster, neater, a little harder to navigate until you get a grip, and a much better product all round. So the old one is in a box, as a back up, and the new one is in place."
Penelope Polins,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great addition to our collection!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,"As a chronic pain patient, I spend a lot of time upstairs icing or heating my spine every day and it can get rather lonely and monotonous, especially during the working week. Having a Fire Stick means I’m not stuck with daytime TV and can escape wherever I want to as a distraction from the pain. I’d recommend one to anyone who has a TV in their bedroom as well as the living room!"
Jazmine Belt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great device - no issues,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2021,"Works brilliantly, all the apps I wanted are available now, including NowTV and Apple TV which were a big part of the reason I decided to buy this. I used the cable that came with the fire stick to plug into the USB on my TV meaning there are no wires hanging out the back to plugs. Amazon sells a shorter cable (around £20 at time of writing) to plus to fire stick into the TV but you don’t need to buy this as the one included is fine. Voice recognition is great, very happy with this."
RICHARD HARRIS,5.0 out of 5 stars,One I will be sticking to in future.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 December 2020,"I bought this as I needed to add an app to my toshiba smart TVs that the tv refused to accept. The fire stick not only solved the problem but I now use it for my Netflix, prime, Disney+ along with all my terrestrial catch up services as I not only find it more responsive but the interface is user friendly and easy to understand. I fully recommend this product as it has made my tv viewing easier and quicker."
Chrome,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic value,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021,"As I’m on a strict data limit, I needed something which would allow me to lower the video quality on Prime Video thereby reducing the data rate.My Sony TV’s built-in Prime app didn’t let me do this but the Firestick Lite that I got allowed me to do this.It’s important to note however that reducing the data rate on the FireStick ONLY reduces it for Prime Video.Netflix allows you to reduce the data rate through the account profiles that you set up & Youtube lets you do it whilst watching a video.Along with Netflix & YouTube, I now have my three main apps which are all set to lower data rates & as an unexpected bonus the FireStick has recognised my Sony TV remote control & works completely from that.This was unexpected & I only found out by accident when I picked up the tv remote & everything worked from that.Well worth the £29.99 in my view & for anyone without a Smart TV it’s a no-brainer."

Ms. J. Stark,5.0 out of 5 stars,New Fire Stick is Blazing!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2021,"I upgraded my Fire stick to this and I Love It!!  Voice recognition is my favourite part, so quick & so easy to find what you are looking for. Alexa is as always very helpful and the whole Fire stick is so much better, I don’t have to constantly unplug to reset, it’s quicker to get from app to app - absolutely amazing wished I had realised I could have upgraded much sooner ."
Lezley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Iis upgraded my older Tv. Perfect.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"I wanted to up grade our old Tv in dinning room. Didn't wish to fork out for new one, as this one I already have was perfect it just didn't have apps etc. As we only use it week days to eat. Well, it's perfect. Definitely worth the money, and now I have a new Tv on the wall. Easy to install and use this is third I have purchased. Excellent value,to up grade my Tv.💯🎥💯"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Resolved,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2020,Important...........after saying that I was disappointed.  BBC iPlayer and ITV hub are now working. Amazon sent an apology. We think may have been teething problems. We are now very happy with it .
John,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bit of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2020,"Lightening fast simplified menu, superb HD quality, strong WiFi receiver much better than the 2nd Gen stick this has replaced. Great upgrade ideal if you don’t need 4K quality. Live TV button on remote nice addition so for UK residents you can download the app TV Player which will provide plenty of free to air channels that sync with the new Live Tv Button on remote."
T,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to install, arrived quickly",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2020,"This is great, has turned an old TV into an internet enabled TV. Bit annoying that it needs it's own power source, but other than that easy to setup and works perfectly. Also a little annoying that there's no agreement with Now TV, but such is life, can't have it all."
tp_79,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good picture quality. Interface could be better,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,"I don't use Alexa or voice control. The one thing I use it for is a streaming box. It's okay for this, but the main menu is information overload. Wish there was a default where you can just see your apps and nothing more, rather than being bombarded with everything else first.Apart from that, picture quality is good and the box is fast to navigate through."
Carrie anne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great we device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2021,We have 3 fire sticks around the house and they are great for the kids (and adults!) Easy to use and easy to set up as your just signing in to accounts like you would via phone or computer.  We also have a couple of Alexas so have combined them to work together. Definitely a gpod buy especially for the price (which at the time of my purchase was down to £24.99)
Joanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,"I love my fire stick, best £20 I have spent. Means I can watch the programmes I like in my room, as I don't like what the others in my household watch (shopping TV, reality shows 😕) I can get BT sport too so can watch all the rugby I want. Loads of stuff on Amazon Prime & is good to see YouTube documentaries and old movies on a larger screen. Brilliant value."
Kj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly easy to set up affordable,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2021,Amazon fire stick and the Alexa are my fav absolutely fav items I ownAmazing qualityGreat brandAlways there to helpKindWorks so wellVery very affordable for all families this is fabulousStreams really wellSo very simple to use and set up even I can do it 😊In every way possible I recommend amazon technology
Mae B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wish I'd got this sooner,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2021,"I have to confess this has really made me smile since it arrived. I have a JVC smart TV with Freeview and also an Amazon Prime subscription, I wasn't really able to use either very well but the Fire Stick has changed that. It's been great having everything in one place and the Alexa feature is pretty fun and useful. I haven't found it an issue using the TV remote for volume control so this basic model works just fine. The added bonus is that ITV Hub works without the annoying buffering I was getting on Freeview and the general stream quality has been great."
Blues Brother,5.0 out of 5 stars,Performs as descibed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2021,Incredibly easy to set up. Plug into TV. Plug into power outlet.Easy to follow on screen instructions to locate your Wi - Fi.Click on your chosen Apps and follow more easy instructions with some password set up on your main device  or computer and you're good to go.Took minutes and no need to be tech savvy in any way.Good product thus far.
TB STEWART,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent bit of kit and easy set up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2021,"I bought this to 'convert' my 65"" plasma to smart TV. Super easy to set up - I already have an echo show, and the two obviously share information, as I didn't have to go through any set up for wi-fi etc.In my instance, my TV only has one HDMI input (as its predominately a large format monitor), so my sky box etc go via a Harman Kardon surround sound system. To set up the Firestick, I used the supplied HDMI extended cable and plugged this direct into an HDMI input on the surround sound. I set the sound to best available and it would seem the two communicate - the surround sound switches to Dolby (and sounds great) when I start the Firestick up.The set up of Netflix/Prime and the catch up channels, although a laborious task, is pretty straight forward.To sum up, if you have a perfectly good working TV that you want to have the functionality of a smart TV, then this  is the best £29 you'll spend!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Fire Stick 5*****,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2021,"Why choose anything other than an Amazon Fire Stick,  it dose everything you ever need for your TV viewing and entertainment.  As lone as you have Internet or WiFi you can watch all sorts of TV platforms.  And play exciting and fun games like THE CHASE,  PACMAN to name a couple.  We have tried others but the format and ease of the AMAZON FIRE STICK  is second to none."
vfrbiker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2020,"Initially liked this product as a replacement for Roku which had run its course. Great Alexa integration with basic fwd, rwd and pause commands.  Now, however, after 7 weeks I have to navigate many prime video adverts before I can get to the app I need. Moreover I have to reset device daily by unplugging from mains as it either freezes with no control from remote or plays without volume. Each reset works but I’m getting rather frustrated with the need to do this. Think I’ll go back to Roku"
Matt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't get any other apps to download.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2020,"Update - I got through to Amazon live chat, I had the wrong country set up, it was showing as Australia and I Live in the UK, once they changed this, All was fixed.I can't seem to get anything to install, I have searched the web and cannot see a solution, it has nothing to do with the 1 click settings or card not being registered, it simply says 'unable to download app', this applies to everything I am trying to download, I tried using the help function built-in but it says it fails to call me."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything works now,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2020,"Our 2013 Panasonic TV which cost an awful lot of money had problems with the Apps.  You tube and I player stopped working - was told this was because the contract with them and Panasonic had expired.  After a very simple installation, we now enjoy all that the TV used to offer plus a good deal more.  Much better than buying a new TV!  Quite delighted"
Old John,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2021,Good piece of kit once I worked out that it needs to be left on (in sleep mode) all the time. Switch off at supply & I had problems with no sound when trying to use it again.There is no off setting on stick.It is a very low wattage appliance & this is the way it is supposed to work. Other than that which is no great hassle I am well pleased with it.
TrevorFarnham,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but could be better,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,Once you get to using this then it makes a good method for accessing online content e.g BBC iPlayer.  However if I had gripes it would be that the user interface is not that intuitive and probably more importantly it often drops the link to wifi meaning you have to restart the device.  Iam ok doing this but not certain a computer novice would like this.
Sonny,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best alternative to costly sky packages,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2021,"We dont have an outside Ariel so the Fire Stick is a welcomed alternative to paying costly sky packages etc.We can watch almost everything and can live stream the regular channels. We do pay for Netflix and Prime subscriptions but this isn’t really necessary as there’s plenty to watch.Quality is good and the price is awesome for what it does. We have one in every room of the house inc kids bedrooms, you can add parent control too if required. Wouldn’t be without one. Highly recommend"
Phil Harrison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought to replace an old Fire Stick that was working very slowly.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,"Our original Fire Stick has started to work very slowly and, now and then, it would stop working completely. We had to disconnect it and reboot it. Since we use it a lot, it was time to buy a new one which promised to be more powerful and efficient. It has worked! We now do not have any annoying waits for the stick to power up and go to our selected choices."
C. Kewley,5.0 out of 5 stars,A marvelous little gadget,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2020,"I received the Fire Stick a couple of days ago, dead easy to set up. I have only had a short time to play with it but find it a boon. Great for finding cartoons for our 2 year old granddaughter and 60s music for myself. Using the Alexa voice control makes it so much easier too. So far, money well spent."
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Improved version,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2020,I’m not very good with “techie” stuff so will keep this brief.This new fire stick is twenty times faster than my old one so for that alone I award five stars.I also like the voice control. There are already two Alexa’s in the house so this feature is unused.I’m glad I bought this and it was during a promotion so the price was good.
David Shepherd,3.0 out of 5 stars,Regularly loses connection to Wifi Hub,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,"When it is up and working this acts as an perfectly acceptable way to access streaming services on an older TV. A little bit slower to respond than my Samsung Smart TV, but very usable and great value. However the Fire Stick regularly loses contact with my WiFi hub when not being used which leads to me having to frequently intervene to get it working."
Tabbycat,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to install,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,I haven’t activated Alexa yet. It was easy to install but the batteries went after two days. I replaced them. I’ve had a few issues with getting from one channel  to another sometimes. I’ve was  advised to contact Amazon helpline. They were helpful and suggested I turned the tv off once or twice a week from the mains to lengthen battery life v
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quility Amazing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,I ordered this as my old one had given up the ghost. I work away from home during the week so I like too watch Netflix .  it is so quick and streams really fast and no buffing .  I could also download more channels like sky and now tv which I had not had before.  The voice recognition is superb.  I have a lot of fire products and I am never disappointed thank you  🙏 A++
fair trade 4 all,1.0 out of 5 stars,Firmware not ready to be used with iplayer and stereo echos,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2020,although amazon customer service told me to buy this rather then the cube it actually performs really badly.  The sound and reliability when in hometheatre mode is woeful. When playing BBC iplayer it buffered every few minutes and even rebooted itself a couple of times.  I believe the developers are to realease ne software but that is of no use if we want to use it now over christmas. And who is to say their update will work to fix this fault anyway.  seems to me it has been release too early. I think 4th gen echo suffers from that to.
CAMBROB,4.0 out of 5 stars,Brill,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2021,"We.bought the firestick lite as our old tv doesn't have All 4 or Disney plus (we were using son's  old xbox for Disney). Just stuck the stick in back of tv and into the mains. No looking back! Press the button, say what you want to watch and voila...that easy. No more changing HDMI port - it does that itself, no then finding the app needed, straight to the programme. No going back now - much cheaper.than a new TV!"
Caz Donovan,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Great Device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,"My grandson bought this for me for my Christmas present.  It's great, I've been able to catch up on missed programmes, and am looking forward to seeing whats films I can watch.  It's great that it's Alexa voice activated, saving time on finding programmes that I want to see.  I've so far only used it for playing music and viewing iplayer, looking forward to finding what else is available.  A great gift."
A L,3.0 out of 5 stars,Firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2021,"The firestick is great, had no problems setting it up. My only complaint is the parental settings, you can set it to kids mode, but it's easy to navigate out of that and into the prime store. You can set up a 4 digit pin code, but it would be better if there was a way to hide adult content all together. I've been trying to turn of the 1 click purchase option on amazon prime on my TV. But can't seem to work out how to do it."
Ed Mead,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enhances streaming services!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2021,"I thought my telly was pretty new, but I've had difficulty receiving britbox and disney. The firestick enables me to watch these services with absolutely no hassle. Plus, my broadband seems a bit stretched watching netflix, all other devices in the house need to be off, but with the hdmi extender this acts as a kind of amplifier, so all in all the firestick is a god send!"
JayBee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good option for non smart TV's,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2020,"This is the 2nd fire stick I have purchased, the first was for my son's non smart tv and this one is for another non smart tv.Great product, well made and does the job really well.It's very easy to set up and works as it should.Very pleased with this product and based on my experience I would recommend.Thank you :O)"

Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great addition and great voice control functionality.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"I bought the Amazon fire stick for our upstairs tv, it has been a great addition being able to access amazon tv, Disney +, Netflix and many other features via voice control through the remote. Voice searching is fast, convenient and accurate even for my west country accent. Heartedly recommend especially during the discounted price sales."
Belle,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, easy to use and set up.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2021,"I am a bit of a technophobe I had an old generation 1 which was struggling to download and stream. I decided to upgrade to the new stick with Alexa which I have avoided as I hate devices 'listening in'. After reading up on this stick I found Alexa you need to press and hold the button for it to 'listen'. Which I love.  My new stick I followed the instructions, logged in alright and off I went! I did have to download BBC iPlayer, more 4 etcetera. Far faster than my old stick. Highly recommend.  My fibre broadband speed is 36 Mb so not the fastest."
Brainwave,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily upgrade your HDTV to a smart TV.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,"Everything you need to turn your TV into a smart TV. All leading video and music Apps available. Not all are loaded up first but you can add others you need later from Apps section. Works fast, good quality. Top tip, If you have a Sony TV it’s remote control can control this including volume, you will just need to use the firestick controller for Alexa."
Simon G. Cole,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality ???,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2020,"I bought one of these for football crazy uncle with learning difficulties. I set it up, explained how to work it, left him to it. 24 hrs later had a call to day he keeps getting message that home service not available. Went back, eventually had to restore back to factory settings.  Then another call to say message came up. Went back got it working again and we sat down to watch a programme. 30 mins later we were kicked out and the stick faulted again.  Not happy. Will probably have to send damn thing back for replacement.#ihatetechnology."
F. A. L. Elphick,3.0 out of 5 stars,Dislike Alexa,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,I find it hard to use. Alexa for me is not an essential tool. I don't like the feeling it overhears my conversations either. I find the whole screen too complicated with loads of 'apps' and pictures of films. Easier to use a straight forward television. I can also use Amazon primes channels through my P C. which is easy to understand.
dash471,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well but has connection issues,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 March 2021,Hi managed to get it setup fine and runs ok.However there seems to be a bug in the code somewhere. When your router reboots the fire stick can not reconnect without being powered off and on again. This is even mentioned on the leaflet in the box so it’s a known problem that is not mentioned in the product details. Needs fixing.
CJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast loading,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021,"The built in Amazon Prime app on my smart TV had become so so slow that it was frustrating to bother using. So I bought a fire stick to in effect do the same thing. Amazon Prime is so quick running on it, much easier to scroll through. Have the added bonus of loads of other optional apps to install and watch on my TV, particularly handy to fight the boredom during lockdown."

Took time to find WIFI connection but good at the moment.  My WIFI  gets its moments of loosing the connection but it is for extended bedroom and when it works well pleased with firestick ,bought at £18 now back to £30  very happy .Good Apps would be suitable  for main television i have  Prime on Android TV but older TV with full HD would be ideal .If you have a smart 4k go for the 4k firestick and enjoy ."

Gemma W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes a normal tv a smart tv for a fraction  of the cost!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2021,"Bought in sales to replace 1st gen firestick which was coming to the end of its life, it's amazing, my old one although had been well used was getting a bit old and leggy, this one is much faster and no buffering, the voice control makes it much easier searching for specific programs, would have been happy with it paying full price."
Stephen Carroll,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what I need it to.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,I bought one of these to plug into a monitor rather than a TV to allow us to sort of use it as a smart TV without needing to keep logging on to the PC and make it easier for the kids.It has all the apps I need and the remote is simple but allows you to move through the menus and control what you are watching easily enough.
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous product!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,"We have two of these now and I bought a third for my parents. This makes watching Disney + on a non smart tv a reality. Before we could only access it on the iPad, even our 5 yr old smart tv couldn’t cope with the updates required for it and Now tv. Having the fire stick means we can watch the latest YouTube on any of our TVs"
Nick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fire Stick is a YES,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2021,"Easy to fit and follow instructions to install and Log In. After that, the whole is your oister! The Alexa Voice control is simple, pressing a button rather than operating all the time. Good voice regognition and therefore quick to operate, paricularly for music request. Easy to locate Amazon Prime, YouTube, BBC I-player, etc. So if you don't aleady have it installed in TV set, worth every penny!"
Mancgas,1.0 out of 5 stars,Compared to ‘full’ version its poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2021,"We’ve got several Fire Sticks of all ages- all work fine. Freezes, every programme with advertising break goes back to begining of the programme rather than picking up fro where advert cut in. Re started it, wiped and reinstalled done same with affected apps ie All4 - still does same. Spend an extra £5 and get a proper one!"
Cindy,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s ok,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,Yes the fire stick is a good investment if you don’t want to pay the extortion prices of sky or any other digital box.I do sometimes have issues with Alexa voice recognition but after repeating myself 3 times if she doesn’t get it I ask for something else or turn it off.I’m having trouble with the network connection and hdmi connection. Even with the adaptor the internet drops on it. Even tho the connection to my phone is ok. If I don’t connect it to the hdmi properly before turning it on the sound will not work so have to turn it off and on again.These are common issues with most digital things. Just have to be patient and persevere.Picture quality is good when connected to the internet properly. Most of the time it’s great.
marshman1,3.0 out of 5 stars,Check sound settings,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2021,"This is my third fire stick  but although the picture is good, the menu is not so good as on a smaller tv  you need a magnifing glass to see the icons . I have a fire tv box with 4k ultra and a 2 year old fire stick which works perfect with a good size menu.The new fire stick is ok if you have  a 55 inch screen but in a bedroom with a 26 inch screen its hard to read.Also  the sound does not work  on a tv unless  you change the settings from dolby to stero [pcm]."
"Richard, Leicester",5.0 out of 5 stars,So easy to setup and use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2020,"Just plug it in, pop some batteries in the remote. Choose your language. Enter your wifi details. Then it updates and good to go. For the voice control you don't have to preface ""Alexa..."" you just say what you want whilst pressing the microphone button. Much faster than the original Firestick. Pleased I made the upgrade."
Dilpreet Singh Gill,3.0 out of 5 stars,Problems and bugs,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"After using it for a couple of days, I've noticed some issues. When you try to mirror your smartphone or pc with mirroring feature, It says connecting and after a few seconds it suddenly exits the mirroring feature for no reason. Tried to do that using different devices but no success. Apart from that, if it loses the wireless connection with router, it doesn't connect automatically afterwards and asks you to do it manually. Even though you do it manually, it keeps asking to reconnect the device with a wireless connection, that seems to be a bug. Since there is no option to shut down the device on remote, you have to turn off and turn on your tv or simply unplug the firestick power plug so that it can refresh itself to re-establish the connection with WiFi. Pretty disappointed tbh... wondering if roku was a better option."
Mr Michael Bufton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to setup, lots of content",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021,I haven't reviewed the voice recognition or Alexa integration as we don't use these controls.We bought the stick so we could access Disney plus and it met those requirements.Really easy to setup.Very impressed with the ease of use and all the additional content that is available.Highly recommended!
Topcat 1001,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,"We have an old firestick which used to take us ages to navigate to where we actually needed to be so i thought whilst this was on offer we'd give a go.So worth it! Much quicker to navigate to programmes,, Iplayer, prime etc and the Alexa voice control is so easy to use.So glad we purchased this, well worth the money."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My second Fire TV stick, doesn't work so well as the first",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"This device is the second of two that I have, it is used purely as a streaming assistant for the most popular TV prog's, For some reason or another it will not work with Prime , the movie titles are clearly on show but when choosing a Prime movie, the picture starts to stream then the streaming indicator just stays rotating for ever"
Luke,3.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful what you ask for,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2021,"Voice recognition is okay but you can inadvertently start watching premium content. You will also need to make sure your kids don’t start ordering stuff. My five year old had signed up to Amazon music without my knowledge, or his. Frustrating that the fire stick seems to disconnect from internet regularly. When working tho it is a good platform for viewing Netflix/prime in one place and very easy to set up."
alandavid,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good alternative to Blu-ray,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,"As a subscriber to several media apps , that had become unsupported by Blu-ray, a timely price reduction on the fire stick plus  those apps  being supported by Amazon meant a seamless change over to this system.The technology works well and the picture quality is good, also its worth googling for tips, shortcuts and formatting."
Nosyt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vast improvement over the 1st generation Fire Stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2021,"Been running a first generation Fire Stick for some years now and, of late, it has been terribly slow to use. Menus in particular with many channels just timing out after selection (My5, Channel 4 for example).Factory resets etc etc on the old model failed to make any difference and we concluded that it was our not so fast broadband at fault.However it was suggested that we try the newer model and - instantly - much improved performance. No menu lag, no timeouts and so on.Very pleased."
Kenan Isbilir,4.0 out of 5 stars,does the job,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2020,"easy to set up, works good. the remote is a bit flimsy, as the back cover started to become a little lose, but it is still working ok. Wifi internet connection has dropped twice and it took a bit of time and restarting the device to re-establish it, as it seemed not coming back automatically. Overall, good product for the price."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great mobile TV reception.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,"A brilliant product if you have broadband/wi fi, but no TV antenna. I use it in a room where I did not want to install a new antenna cable. The reception is excellent and I can watch live TV, catch up or streaming services. I also use the fire stick in my motorhome and connect via a hot spot on my phone. This allows me to get UK television whilst abroad provided I get a reasonable data signal. The firestick is  great value for money."
Kunle,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2021,Very good product. Does exactly what it says. The only drawback I have is the installation and connection process. So many software updates to be done and the sign up process gave me a lot of tough time because the product user Amazon account wouldn't just work with it until I have to sign up a new account for the user. The second drawback is that some application I am expecting are not on the apps store although all that was listed on the product add were available. Overall I will recommend this product for any one who has the patience to go through the installation processes
Robert Hall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than expected,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,"I have what must be an early smart tv, and I could not get amazon prime on it, which is why I bought this.  Not only can I get Amazon Prime Video, I can also get ITV Hub, channel 4 catch-up and myfive, all of which I could not get before. This is a brilliant thing, and much cheaper than a new TV!  Highly recommended."
Rilk,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2021,"When channel 5 stopped streaming to my kitchen tv I was disappointed. When channel 4 stopped streaming, I was gutted. I was told about the fire stick and it was the best decision I made to get one. I would have had to buy a new TV to get the channels I was missing but the firestick Is by far the best thing ever! Love it!"
Robert James Simpson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2021,"Very pleased with my fire TV stick, it has all the apps I want, some of which disappeared from my smart TV, hence me buying this product in the first place. I have  had no problems with streaming, and I particularly like the ability to voice search for a programme or film, with results from all services displayed. Only glitch I have noticed up to now is on the All4 app where of I pause a programme and then restart it, at the next ad break it sometimes goes back to the beginning of the episode! Thus may well be an issue with the app provider though so won't dock a star over it!"
Darren C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,So much quicker than the old ones!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2021,Bought the new gen fire stick to replace an old 1st gen stick that was used in my bedroom. It really is night and day in comparison with speed as this new fire stick absolutely blazes through tasks and it boots to the Home Screen in a fraction of the time compared to the old one. Very happy indeed with the upgrade.
elsie13,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved me money on new tv.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,I was going to upgrade my tv by buying a new one . My son said my present tv was ok but would be much improved by simply buying a Fire Stick Lite.  I took his advice and was quite sceptical but to my surprise it worked beautifully. It virtually loaded itself  without any fuss and now I have a much better choice of programmes. One happy bunny!
Natalie D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought as a I needed a remote control for the old one .,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 December 2020,"I really like the fire stick but I only bought this as I needed a remote control for my old one replacing.Its about time a replacement remote is made available that doesn't cost as much as the whole firestick package.  And yes I tried the remote on the phone app and it was dreadful, only worked intermittently."
S6D3,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,The product overall is pretty good. Would’ve given 5 stars but I bought one for me and my mum we both have had the same problems sometimes the screen just goes blank and you have to unplug it to restart it and to make it work again. We have this problem mainly with Netflix when we’re just watching a movie the screen will go blank and restarting it won’t do anything you will have to unplug. But it’s a good product and the Alexa voice control is really helpful and it’s really fast I love the start up sound it makes but if you want to get the best out of your product I would suggest using it on a new TV as my TV is pretty old and makes a certain noise. And I don’t think the issue where it blacks out is with my TV because my mums one does the same thing and her TV is new
Anthony,5.0 out of 5 stars,Revives older TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,We had subscribed to a streaming service that one of our TVs didn't support. The fire stick provided the ability to watch the service and many others in one place. The remote is brilliant and the Alexa integration makes finding and searching very easy.I am looking to get another for the TV in our gym.
David of Almondsbury,5.0 out of 5 stars,More choice!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2020,"It's a great product. I already had a Fire Stick and bought this one for the bedroom TV so we could ""YouTube"" in bed. I'm not sure what the star rating for 'Thickness' means so I gave it 3 stars.  If there is a USB socket on your TV you can power the Fire Stick from that rather than having to use a 13 amp socket."
Wiseowl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost faultless streaming of Netflix content,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2021,This was a replacement for a much older firestick and I don't know why I didn't replace it sooner.  It responds quickly to remote and to voice though I haven't had to use alexa much at all. Signing up to Netflix was easy.  Setup very easy. Almost faultless streaming - no visible buffering at all of HD content so the one incidence I have experienced so far of a nano-second picture distortion may have been caused by an internet issue. So far I have only used it for Netflix so can't comment on any other services
Mahi Rahman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good budget home entertainment alternative,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2020,"Good budget home entertainment and alternative to standard satellite channels if you watch movies online. If you have amazon prime or an old non  ""smart tv"" you can make it smart and modern compatible with many devices or use your internet to watch amazing shows and movies on the cheap and in HD. Can't help it but recommend but if you want to do gaming from Android Google Store or have nice OS running on it then you are off better buying alternative brand ""Android TV Box"" which will fully support android and its features."
TY R GRAIG,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, So far though a few gliches.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2021,"I have had the Fire stick Sincerely the beginning of March now, an So for it has performed ok so for though there have been a few disappointments.1: the streaming qualityhas been a bit glich.2: a few times the device has stores, given tge reason for it being a result of internet connection. I performed a few tests at the times and found the internet connection to be performing we'll.I only bought this as a replacement to my original fire stick as it stores working.As a replacement I can not say that this newer and upgraded version is of any improvement on my first one.I am going to monitor before contacting amazon about the issues."
J. Laidler,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but power and volume issues,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2020,Simple reasons for 3 stars.1. Why does it not automatically use USB power to power it. I needed a new socket gang to accommodate it. Cable I bought separately from Amazon doesn’t take enough power from the tv2. Disney+ volume. Seems to be a common complaint. Why is the volume so low on this app compared to all others?But still pleased I bought one and the lite version is more than enough for my purposes
L. Best,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,"Wasn't sure if I would get along with it or not, but I do and I love it. I can access so many things on there. Everything from the Internet for my skillshare, YouTube, prime videos, Spotify and Disney plus. Just to name some of my favs. So many things to do. Easy to use. Don't know why I put it off for so long."
oldgit,4.0 out of 5 stars,easy to set up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,the set up was quite easy and it loads much faster than my old fire stick my only bug on it is getting the sound to synchronise have tried the adjustment side but so far not quite right so I am trying by moving 1 step at a time to get it right so fingers crossed if not for this problem it would have been 5 star on all
David Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Plug and play,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2021,"All you need to know is that it's simple to install..plug in and play. Once installed choose the Apps you want most require subscription and download, follow the easy to read instructions on screen and off you go. Remote to use microphone to instruct Alexander works well e.g "" find me a war romantic comefy"" 5 seconds later a great selection is available."
sue,5.0 out of 5 stars,Replacement for my previous one.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2020,I had been having problems with receiving Netflix etc. and couldn't seem to troubleshoot the cause (as in is it my broadband or firestick)? after three days of it saying no signal on screen I spoke to Amazon customer service and they advised trying a new firestick which I did so problem solved......thankfully.
Julie McCarthy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon fire stick brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020,The fire stick is brilliant brought a small smart tv for my disabled daughter when it came it didn’t have the apps I required the main app Disney+ as I’m Subscribe to it now don’t use the tv apps just the fire stick got everything I need. The Quality of the picture seems better than the TV at picture. Very pleased
maurice,5.0 out of 5 stars,My T.V is smarter now.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"Easy replacement for current original version of Firestick. I noticed how much faster this 'booted up'. Much faster for finding programmes by using 'Alexa' voice commands. Did not have to 'train' her to recognise my voice either. Generally vast improvement, well worth the investment. It's made my t/v smarter than before!"
jen60,3.0 out of 5 stars,It's OK,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,"Had to phone help desk to get it set up, that took over 30 mins, as their computer kept going down.Some programs the picture quality and sound are so bad  you can't watch.I do try and use the voice commands when I know what program to view, otherwise it's a crawl through the programs I can view."
Peter Ditchfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,A cheap and easy replacement for my broken aerial,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2021,"Love the Firestick Lite. I’ve been without a working aerial for my tv for about 3 years relying on my iPad to watch most tv as not all the tv apps allow streaming to my tv using my old Apple TV box but now I can watch all the standard tv channels plus so much more straight on my tv and all for the cost of about £30, less than it would have cost to get someone 4 stories up onto my roof to even look at my aerial. Haven’t really tried to set up the Alexa as not really interested so can’t comment on that."
Selene,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2021,"Bought to plug into our projector.  Can't complain, the quality is spot on and the alexa voice recognition saves a lot of time! Opted for the lite as I didnt need the additional controls for casual use.  The hdmi adapter is handy as well if you can't fit the stick directly in the port due to limited space."
Mr. M. Randall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2021,"Excellent ! Have been wanting one fof a while and its lives up to expectations.Its easy to set upVery easy to useStreaminh is fast and the image clear..i have not had a single moment of buffering or slow loading.Every app works wellBbc, Ch 4, ITV, netflix, prime, disney, uktv"
Willow,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Firestick so far.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,Superb Firestick. I had an older version which had become very slow to respond to any commands. This new Alexa one is brilliant! It’s super quick and I’ve now got the added advantage of being able to use voice commands to find movies etc. Fantastic. Well pleased and at a very good price. Highly recommend!
mallorca80,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great remote , but the software not quite as good",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"I really like the remote control as its so easy to navigate and it is a Bluetooth so doesn't actually need to be pointed to the tv. What I don't like is the newest version of the software - it won't show the icon of most of the sideloaded apps. It show grey squares only .I have one of the previous versions and no problem whatsoever with any icons of the apps .As I mainly use the stick with sideloaded apps it is a big let down , but hopefully this will be sorted in some of the following updates. Been using amazon prime for a nearly month so far - for its propose it is a great gadget . I would recommend  OTG cable and USB hub with RJ45 port so can be hard wired to the router for best performance and using memory stick too for your own videos"
david,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth getting,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2021,"Wanted one for the kitchen tv as we already have one for the living room.Actually find it a bit better than the more expensive one in there, possibly because it's a newer model. Of course the only downside is that this model has not got the volume control for the tv, but apart from that it's great."
David Jakes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2020,"I previously had a first generation model. The ""Lite"" is much faster responding to the user. It looks no different to the other generation models. The only real difference is that it does not have any TV controls, but it really isn't needed. I am ordering another as a gift for a friend. Highly recommended."
AlinaB,5.0 out of 5 stars,Transforms old TV in smart TV!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"This is for who does not have a smart TV but would like the same advantages, all you need is a hdmi port, the rest is very easy to setup and you have access to Internet, netflix, amazon prime etc exactly like a smart TV, so if you don't want to change your TV yet I definitely recommend the fire stick, with or without a remote."
Dave B,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even I could do it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2020,This was miraculous. Virtually plug and play. The stick certainly appeared to work better when plugged into mains rather than USB. A bit of time spent logging into various channels which was painless and  we were up and running. In retrospect may have chose more expensive version with TV controls but no problem. Fully recommend.
T,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible customer service,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2020,"So disappointed got this product to stream movies etc to a projector as a gift for my partner gave them to him, but the firetv stick remote control was not working. We spent 3 hrs on the phone being transferred to 7 different people in total in 7 different countries to resolve our problem and what made me very sad after all that time waiting the last man dealing with our problem he put the phone down on me. Terrible customer service I’d never buy from amazon again!"
tony forrest,3.0 out of 5 stars,No Bbci player app,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2020,Disappointed that that I cannot get BBC I player appI can from the internet but app not available
Curly,1.0 out of 5 stars,User menu is far to complicated,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2021,Each time you pause a film for a few minutes you have to restart the application such as Netflix from the start menu again.I also don't like that it has no sound output on starting the stick up and it has to be restarted through settings.Overall the menu is very long winded and the old menu design of an older stick is much better.
Tieri,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Slow, unresponsive and unreliable!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2021,"I usually rate Amazon devices but this was slow, unresponsive, and kept cutting out.The sound was so temperamental and would only work for short amounts of time.In the end I returned it and opted for the 4K fire stick, which is currently on offer for an extra £5.So far so good, and it is so much better than this version."
Eck,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for Xmas (for kids age 5 - 105)),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 December 2020,'Lite' version is just as capable & awesome as the full version & I'd highly recommend it as a Christmas present for a loved one. It not only provides TV but an abbundent of games for all ages - I know we want to keep kids away from TV 24/7 but the educational aspects {from some of the educational games} null that point & it's a proven fact that kids learn better through gameplay than classes & textbooks.Eck ~ Scottish nickname for Alex
Kev,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unreliable,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"When it works it is fine, and much faster response than its predecessor - especially if used with the ethernet cable adaptor rather than wi-fi.  BUT every day or so when we come to use it we find there is video but no sound with it, necessitating it being unplugged and rebooted - then it's fine again."
djm,3.0 out of 5 stars,not that impressed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2021,"Had the first Fire TV stick replaced, (after some haggling with the customer service assistants). The stick would freeze and lose audio every time it was switched off, forcing you to delete and restart  the whole setup. It has lost audio again since the replacement arrived but only once. Not happy."
Eamonn Murphy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"Out in the country, our broadband connection isn't great but this still works. Great for easy access to multiple television apps. You have to be careful to distinguish between what's free and what must be paid for but it does give you notice. Easy to use even for non-technical old duffer like me."
Diver Paul,5.0 out of 5 stars,better than its predecessor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2021,"This stick was for my son's TV in his room.  We have another 1st gen stick in the living room.  The difference is huge.  The firestick that my son has sets up dead easy and he started using voice recognition straight away.  Menu is different as well, much better.  All in all its cracking device."
Grant Cooper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bargain price, small issue tho with Amazon prime sport picture",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2021,"Bought this before Xmas when reduced to £17.99, was a bargain for that price, I only gave it 3 stars for picture quality because of one small issue im having regarding prime sport, mainly the football, the pic is very bright and the motion not 100% smooth, I thought the problem might have been my internet speed but I tried watching the same football on prime using the prime app on my sky q box using the same internet and the pic was smoother + the brightness was lower and more real life like so the issue Def with the firestick, whether it's just a settings issue I don't know but for streaming TV programmes or films it's 5 stars, only the live streaming sport I'm having issue with"
A Mitchell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for miniaturized high tech,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Had been using an old sony PS3 to access various streaming services for an old non smart TV. However, once BBCiplayer stopped being supported in October , time to invest in a cheap streaming stick. Invested in the basic firestick for £20.Once plugged in , set up was straight forward. Have been very happy with the range of streaming and catch services available. Good picture quality, and Alexa  functionality a useful add-on. All in all a very cost effective way to obtain most of the streaming and catch services available - just a shame Now TV not supported."
Metalnik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really excellent oroduct and dead easy to setup,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020,Only really  bought it to watch britbox. Wired it into the tv and automatically recognised  by wifi and in my alexa app - selected britbox app from start up menu. then  sends code to ipad  and up and running.Noticed picture quality  betteron apps  than via sky hd box and sony 4kbd player
Darcy27,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2021,Bought for my grandad as he can’t get out the chair much these days so tv is all he has. He was over the moon!! The fact that he can speak to it and it will find what he wants is brilliant. He loves he’s Netflix and prime video - defo worth the money. I also have one and never had a problem.
AJW,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2021,Best buy I have made in years providing a quick cheap upgrade to my ancient basic HD TV. I already have prime so took out a cheap Netflix subscription and am now spoilt for choice when it comes to viewing. Easy to set up and navigate the options. Just one regret - I should have done it sooner!
POM,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly with HD projector and enables phone streaming.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2021,"Purchased to use with a projector. Perfect combination. I'm using https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B082TP8TMX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_67Y8Fb9VHPWNT Ape-man full HD projector. Movies are great. As an added bonus, it allows wireless phone streaming to the projector. Imagine a 300"" high definition phone screen!"
Mark Skinner,3.0 out of 5 stars,No as good as the previous model,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2021,I didn’t like the new layout it seem too bare where as the old screen layout looked fuller. The tool bar should be at the top of the page.  The remote doesn’t have volume controls which is poor for the price. The unit went down in price a week later. Not as good as the previous model in my view.
Mr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,"Good stuff, cheap nfl streaming stick for us brits. Literally only got it for that purpose because our smart tv, consoles etc do the same thing so it’s really good.It is a bit clunky though and can be quite slow so if you’re upgrading a dumb tv, this might not be the thing for you..."
Dave,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, good price, compatible with my 5 year old tv",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2020,"Decided to stop paying for T.V Licence as the quality of television was not suited to my interests. Invested in Amazon Fire Stick as a replacement option for home entertainment. Good Selection of films, music, box sets and am pleased I made that choice for my own needs.I only had the basic so no complaints, only a slightly larger handset would be better for my own disability needs. however, I can operate it fully. So, not a complaint just a personal thing that I adjust to in my life.Recommend as a choice if you do not like television and paying for a tv licence."
Rainking,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick and Responsive,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"Picture quality is excellent and number of apps plenty. Performance is also excellent. Managed to grab the stick while on sale and probably should have grabbed two. It helps to have signed up to prime and a few of the paid apps like Netflix etc... It’s easy to use, i.e. to pause and rewind."
FS38,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2020,"This is a low cost way to access, on older tv sets,  lots of channels and features available as standard on new smart tvs. Great value for money, fairly straightforward set up. Takes a little while to get used to navigating via the remote. Getting this meant not having to buy a new smart tv!"
graham whiteley,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Absolute bargain, it's a winner all around",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2021,"Got this model for under £18,, its a no brainer! Instantly installed in a few minutes,picture quality fabulous, remote super fast, I really can't fault it! I've a 4k one on the main TV, obviously the picture is slightly better, depending on the input! But I can highly recommend the cheaper one! The only thing it won't do is control your TV,but that's really irrelevant!"
darkcurrent,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fire TV Stick Lite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"Bought this new version of the Fire TV Stick Lite for a 2nd TV and it is much better than the earlier generation(s).Biggest improvement seems to be reaction speed and, so far, this new version hasn't needed a hard reboot (power off and on) to resolve a screen freeze/no response issue.  Access to a better range of apps than when the older generation was launched although I haven't checked if I can access these newer apps with my first generation TV stick as yet.I would have preferred the remote with TV controls version but it wasn't in stock so went for this cheaper version and glad I did."
D. Fenton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good device from Amazon.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2020,"This fire stick lite now enables me to watch the Mandalorian and other series on Disney plus, so when the grandsons visit they can watch Pixar movies and Disney classics.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon fire stick lite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2020,"Bought the fire stick lite for our very small, old TV downstairs. It's just as good as the full hd fire stick except you have to use the TV remote to do the volume and change over to the HDMI channel. I wouldn't be without it. I can use Amazon video, BBC I player, Amazon music, netflix etc. It's grand."
The One!,4.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,Ordered the 4k on black friday deal but mistakenly cancelled... it was the sold out so got this (at the higher price) :( Upgrades my old firestick and I'm very impressed. Very smooth and virtually no lag.Not too concerned about 4K but look forward to atmos on the Arc via DD+
Gee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2021,"Absolutely incredible product. I have one within each room to be able to stream shows and programs. Able to save money off BT service as now not requiring all the channels provided.Perfect with Alexa, voice control so simple though you must be precise with what you say but after a while it becomes natural.Though this is the lite version its great."
Mr. D. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the bedroom,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2021,"Wanted a small device for a wall mounted TV in the bedroom. This is perfect. I've gone through a lot of Android TV devices and for the money, this is one of the best I've had.

FW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Cheap to buy easy to use  it the biggest pain is signing to all iplayer, ITV Hub, etc",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2021,"This the second TV firestick I have bought , the first was from currys PC World for my wife which is great for iplayer and  catchup tv, the second one is from Amazon and it's just as good it,s the lite version and after downloading updates and the apps I wanted,  we both use it mainly for Netflix HD version which is extremely good value and I have it on several devices. I also have a couple of Huawei boxes but they are very slow to start up each time you use them but the firestick is faster and is much better for my needs.I suppose all other versions work equally well but I have only used the basic firestick..."
Mrs Hutt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good so far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2021,"I haven't really used the whole lot of features so can't rate them. We have a Fire Stick in the living room which we use loads! I wanted one in the bedroom, which is this new one.  Just for watching something at bedtime it is perfect.  I will have a go with the voice controls and Alexa shortly"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,Bought this for a Samsung TV that has no WiFi as cheaper than getting a dongle. Plugged in and connected straight away to WiFi and my Amazon account. Downloaded all streaming services no problem and picture quality is great. Only downside is having to plug into the main and cable to power it from TV is £20 extra. Otherwise cannot fault it.
Mr Diddles,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Parents love it, easy to use.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 May 2021,"I bought this for my parents as their TV is having problems connecting to WiFi and it works fantastic, I no longer get calls asking for help because the TV isn't working when they actually just went into the menu and don't know how to back out. Within 5 minutes of teaching them how to use it and letting them play around with it they already knew what was where and how to get on to each app."
SleepingDogz,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Great Device but buffers from time to time,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"Great Fast Navigation with in the menu compared to the Amazon fire stick 1st generation, only thing that lets it down is this new 2020 stick keeps buffering from time to time. The Alexa voice control is superb and saves time typing what you want to watch in the search bar. 8/10 overall."
PRich,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"The Lite is very good but I'd be tempted to pay the extra and get the one with TV controls, mainly because of the convenience of one remote. They are great though and very easy to use. I really like the Alexa option, though it's not perfect, especially if searching for YouTube videos."
KersReview,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2020,"This has been a great move for a familyMember bedridden and limited to freeview. With aHDMI in her tv and with us having prime it was an ideal addition. She now has access to prime, Netflix, Disney+, loads of terrestrial on demand services and our kids can go up and watch the same things that glue them downstairs. Fantastic product and easy to install!"
KMills,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,"The sounds keeps going off every few days.I’ve followed the instructions, changed things around and it still keeps going off!I have to pull the plug and reboot it. But every other day is getting really silly now.I’ve thrown the original box away so I can not return it"
S Wilkes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2020,My son told us that our fire stick was out of date after I blamed the Internet for a very jerky streamed football match. I bought the new Fire Stick and the difference is amazing. Next game we watched had far better streaming and was on a par with watching on regular TV. Can use Alexa as well!
Bokshi Sasa,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with it.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2020,Quite easy to set up apart from getting the apps like ITV player YouTube and so on. You have to go and set you your bank details and so on before it will let you download. There is no charge but it needs your card details.Picture is good and the Alexa remote works really well.
Marie Marks,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really easy to install,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2021,"This was so easy to install and works brilliantly. It has updated our Sony Bravia completely. We can now watch Amazon prime, Netflix and all the catch up channels on this TV - which we couldn't before. It's a neat little remote control and is intuitive to use. Can't fault it - wish we'd done it ages ago. We don't have Alexa so I haven't scored that."
D. M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even I could set this up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021,Easy to set up . Made me think why did I not buy this earlier . Attached to an older Sony tv in spare room giving them YouTube Netflix BBC iPlayer etc which I never thought would be possible so doesn't have to be a super up to date tv as long as it has a HDMI connection on the tv
kate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fine,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2021,"I bought this for myself and my son as we only every watch Netflix, BBC iPlayer or Amazon. It works absolutely fine, the remote is fine, the only downfall is that the sound sometimes doesn't work so I have to plug it in and out but I'm unsure if that's down to the stick or my TV."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Like it but can't get surround sound to work,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2021,"I like this new stick. It is responsive and easy to use. However, I can't get the surround sound to work with my soundbar. Only stereo works. Tried all the sound settings. I get Dolby 5.1 from my BT box working fine  when connected to the HDMI port on the soundbar or via ARC from the TV but just can't get this to work from the Fire Stick with the same connection. I see there are a few other reviewers with the same problem. I hope they look at this and fix what looks like a compatibility issue."
Charlie woo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Voices out of sync,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,Can't watch certain apps as the voices are out of sync especially on Disney plus app went through all trouble shooting customer service was really helpful and sent me a new one and the new one is the same voices out of sync so can't watch it disappointing as I have a old version of firestick and had no problems
(Connor) BIG MAN SHOUT,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is worth the purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2021,"I have recently purchased this for my niece and here are the pros and cons I have found with this product.Pros) I like the new set up, it was a bit confusing at the start due to the old set up but got very easy to understand.Cons) Its £30 with no volume controls but last year I bought a fire tv stick with volume controls for only £30 and is now £39.99!"
Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Turned my old led monitor into smart tv :),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2020,"Flawless installation, apps downloading and syncing with my Amazon account. I can watch now on my 9 yr old monitor YouTube, Netflix, prime movies, music, bbc, itv, etc. It's quick and responsive, no lags. My monitor is only 1080p so don't need 4k. Picture quality is great. Very happy. Highly recommend."
Deryck G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Aging set feels like new,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2020,Arrived quickly and easy to install although I have not linked Alexa as she is working downstairs and TV stick upstairs at the back of house. It has bred new life into an aging TV with clear picture and a good range of apps.
ajsr39,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great value, all stresming apps in one location",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2021,"Love everything about this firestick. Was bought as a gift and I love it. So easy to use. Only downside is the amount you have to pay for on prime. However, good stick for other apps which are quick to manoeuvre with non-buffering streams. I have borrowed a friends firestick with the tv controls and can say I see no difference therefore this is a very good value for money."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but prefer the old home screen",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,"Bought for my mum as a gift after she saw ours and wanted one. This is a newer version than the one we have but just as easy to use, although I do prefer the older interface and home screen. We had a few problems with the remote, probably a dodgy battery connection but seems to be working fine now we've fiddled with it a bit."
Mujib,1.0 out of 5 stars,"FAILTY AMAZON FIRE STICK, NEED REPLACEMENT PLEASE.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2021,"Quick delivery which i was happy about, but once i put everything together and plugged it into my tv it just does not CONNECT. i've done EVERYthing, tried to troubleshoot, i followed instruction from Amazon support team, followed instruction manual book, reset the device, used all adapters and mixed around with set up of wiring, reset internet connection, used wifi and ethernet cable, nothing seems to work. I even tried on another tv and i get know where. It must be a FAULTY STICK. please send another AMAZON. i have spent hours trying to connect and not even passing 1st stage on connecting to internet via wifi nor cable, even tried using WPS button. Please send another, very disappointed and frustrated."
paul wheeldon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to setup and use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2021,I already had one Firestick in the back of my TV so I got my self another for my projector as my projector native hd.. so got Firestick TV lite so I did not have to keep borrowing the one from the TV. When it came it was easy to setup and use. Me personally I like the Firestick.
david cadwallader,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great piece of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2021,"I don't have a smart television at the moment,so bought the fire stick to extend my viewing options,and WOW what a difference it can make i should have bought one years ago,to anyone who doesn't have a smart television and would like extra viewing options they should purchase one."
Barbara D,1.0 out of 5 stars,There is no way of controlling the volume using this device.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2021,"I had thought that we would be able to use the volume controls on the tv remote control to manage the volume but this is not the case. When we tried out the fire stick we found that whilst the volume for speech was tolerable [and we are slightly deaf] the volume level of introductory and background music was far too loud, excruciatingly so! I would not recommend buying this device and feel we have wasted our money.Also, when setting up the device, we were given choices of apps. Once these choices are made there does not appear to be any way of altering or adding to them."
Anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to work fine ok so far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"Seems to work so far..... Got this due to our TV no longer being able to receive iPlayer (and couldn't get 4OD or ITVHub !). Works fine on all terrestrial channels I mentioned and more. I only use it for the normal free channels.  Just in case you're not aware when setting this up, to use your remote to switch to the 'HTMI' option as that's where you go through the wizard instructions to set it up. May sound obvious but I just thought things popped up on your screen and didn't realise :-)"
Scott O'Leary,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy use, great addition to my home entertainment options. Thanks.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2021,"The Fire stick itself was a Christmas present (I was already an Amazon Prime user for ordering things but scarcely used Amazon TV/Video until I got the Fire stick) Pretty straightforward to use, great addition to my home entertainment options, nothing to say against it so far."
Susan Osgathorp,5.0 out of 5 stars,New Firestick works really well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2021,"My old Firestick seemed to having problems connecting to iPlayer etc, and frequently stopped. But this new Firestick was very easy to install and works quickly and efficiently. The addition of the Alexa voice recognition feature is a real bonus, as it saves a lot of time trying to remember when and where a programme that we want to watch is to be found!"
R. Read,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fire TV stick for bedroom,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,This was purchased for me as a very welcome Christmas present.  I stopped using the 'Big' tv service providers as it was costing sooooo much for what I could get for nothing (Freestat).  This is the same item as I have in my lounge tv except that one has volume control as well.  It is great for getting extra bits on the tv for my grandchildren.
Anne G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why didn't I buy it sooner?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,"This is a very good add on and has converted my TV into a smart tv with many features all for a low cost. It is easy to use and the picture quality and options are good.I have marked down Alexa, as I do not use the function but for those who do, I am sure it is very good."
"Ralphy, Newcastle upon Tyne.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,Well I didn't expect a firestick lite to be that fast?Lighting quick to access my apps and programmes and no noticeable lag at all!No volume controls on the remote which is irrelevant for our use tbh!Got this on a black Friday deal too!Result 👍😁
Caroline Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2021,"So much faster than my old firestick.  Voice control is brilliant, ""show me horror movies with prime"", can ask to fast forward or rewind.  It also works when not on TV firestick channel, asked it to play one of my playlists and it switched over to correct channel itself."
Ian Hen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2021,"The stick was very good value and was easy to set up, because I was an Amazon prime member my details were already on the stick. Information for movies and TV shows very easy to find, stick lets you pick the genre you are looking for and Alexa helps you find specific programmes easily."
Chuck,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good value, works for me",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,"Decent product,  fair price, delivered on time. Don't use Alexa but User Interface with Remote Control simple, intuitive and responsive. Easy access to Prime content and gave my ageing Viera TV a new lease of life with the browsing capability. Good value, works for me."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great.. when they work,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2021,"fast delivery easy to set up and use, but once left off for an hour or so you cant turn it back on from the remote, has to be turned off by the power supply/plug to get it to come back on tried all the usual fixes new remote batts different power suply diff tv's different ports no luck, So rang amazon and received a replacement and yep exactly the same, did bit research and seems to be quite common with no solution as of yet. Also some times apps will open but nothing will be displayed can still here sound but no picture again a restart is needed, really disappointing always had firesticks but might switch to a roku if this doesnt get resolved soon."
cwhite,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life-saver!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2021,Life-saver! I hadn’t had TV for 2 years. I found the £75 fee for cable unjustifiable. On my own at Christmas because of shielding ( for 9 months by then) decided to risk buying the Fire stick. What a relegation. Just brilliant. Only downside is I want to watch TV all day instead of working from home!Did loose the sound on Christmas Eve and it took me 12 hours to realise I only needed to restart the Fire Stick.
Alexdakid,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great smart features and good value for money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,Was brought a fire stick lite by my brother and his wife for an Christmas present and love it it runs really quick and takes seconds to set up the only thing I don’t like is the remote doesn’t have volume controls or turns my tv on or off other then that it’s amazing
NAM,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Didn’t work, had to return. Disappointing.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2021,"Did not work - kept freezing while trying to set it up. I have an older firestick which works perfectly, bought this one for second tv, spent a very frustrating few hours trying to work out why it wouldn’t even complete set out, gave up on the end, returned it and bought a Roku streaming stick instead, which has been absolutely brilliant."
Nathan bath,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's great for smart devices connect with your alexa,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2021,I suppose it's ok but occasionally it's shuts down reboots automatically then does it again so I shut it down and everything works for a few hours then it starts again tried factory reboots and so far it hasn't done it twice just once as if it's looking for something
sarah lewis,3.0 out of 5 stars,3.5* Average,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2021,"I bought the alexa voice control as i had the older one without as this was on offer i thought why not but i have to say im not overly impressed some things i ask for alexa tells me she cant process that information for example i asked to show me the film bella mafia which alexa couldnt comprehend so i asked for films about women mafia bosses and it said it couldnt comprehend this has happened when trying to search several film titles varying in subject & themes greatly including xmas, Other than that its what i expected soi give it 3.5*"
Pete N,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quick to setup and easy to use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021,"Bought as a replacement for an older fire stick, and can see and feel the improvement.Quick response to turning on, searching, and the Alexa integration is intuitive with the search function working across apps to find programmes.We’ve already found ourselves using it more than the old device."
Mr R Brierley,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok (I guess) if you have fast broadband,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2020,Easy to set up and use with good remote. Audio flakey tho. My download speed is about 8Mbps and audio cuts out totally every few minutes when streaming a movie or youtube so it’s useless for me. I’m back using my Humax box or PS3 for streaming as they don’t cut out.
Coypu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very versatile,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 February 2021,"My kitchen telly just had an aerial so we were only able to watch live tv. My daughter got one of these for her tv so I decided to get one for our kitchen. It is really good. We can now choose to watch catch-up, Prime, Netflix and You Tube. Very good picture as well."
martin broad,5.0 out of 5 stars,does the job,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,Bought as i did not like the interface on my smart tv and also it was on a special deal. Very easy to set up and works well including the voice recognition.Only drawback is sometimes loses network even though the wi fi is working so i have to pull out the power lead and replace.
Jengen,5.0 out of 5 stars,It connected quite easily and works well.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2021,We fitted it into the HDMI socket on the back of our Sonia Bravia tv. The instructions are shown on the screen and are very clear.It recognised our hub and now streams all4 iPlayer etc. It seems to work very well although we haven’t really given Alexa a good trial yet.
Susie Brooks,1.0 out of 5 stars,WORST Firestick ever!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2021,"More like a downgrade than an upgrade from the previous version - this is brilliantly named for being 'Lite' in all respects! Every time I want to use it, I have to unplug and reset it or it just crackles and says there's no signal or gives me a blank/static screen. Even when it connects, it often says 'Home is unavailable' and refuses to display any apps. I thought it must be faulty so sent it back, but the replacement does exactly the same. My TV fits all the compatibility criteria, my Wifi is good; I've spent fruitless hours chatting to tech support (rubbish). Glad I didn't throw away my old firestick - it's slow but at least it works!"
j willett,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Loads up much faster than the original one i had,",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2020,"Bought mainly for the Apple tv app, which my old stick did not have, signal dropped out once last night can only assume this was down to Amazon as when i checked said my connection was fine with no problems, re-started Fire -Stick which now only takes a minute or so and everything was working again."
P. Elliott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super easy to set up and use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2020,"Really like this additional to my Alexa family, so easy to set up and use and love being able to ask Alexa verbally what we want to watch and it finding it and playing it. Good apps also available for most streaming services I needed (shame NowTV isn’t available)"
Mrs Tracy Johnson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely pleased and great picture.  Very easy set up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2021,After using my old one for approx 8 years it finally packed up so ordered this product. Wow.. Technology come a long way since and love it especially Alexa voice control.  Brilliant picture and so easy to install. Can definately recommend. Wish I'd done it years ago.
Ray daniel,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to set up for a dinosaur,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2020,"Just bought the firestick life latest generation,I'm no geek,but found it easy to set up on my old tv,hardest part was remembering my Amazon password.The alexa part worked first time,now it don't,not sure if it's me or I'm doing something wrong,anyone know help."
carolyn m wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great improvement on my 8 year old firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2021,"Great upgrade from my original fire stick . Little or no buffering, features are easy to use . Only downside is the remote that comes with it . If it had a back light it would be better so I use a small wireless remote control keyboard the majority of the time."
TP,2.0 out of 5 stars,A few problems,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,"The picture quality etc is great however it is impossible to change the time and the remote is temperamental, having to rearrange the batteries to unfreeze it (the batteries are the ones that came with it so not drained) Also had a lot of problems using Audible library on the tv."
Megan Kane,5.0 out of 5 stars,Few downfalls but good overall,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2020,"Really handy to use and set up, makes it so much easier to use all of my streaming accounts. You can only use alexa when you've already scrolled into the search section of amazon prime and nowhere else which is the biggest shame. They also need to fix the bug that blocks amazon prime for working. I googled it and it seems quite a few other people had the same issue, I followed the instructions to fix it and never worked so now I have to actually click into the prime video app rather than just using the stick home screen. It is a good little gadget other than that so if they fixed that, it'd be perfect."
A Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,problems,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2021,"badly manufacture hdmi port meant first one had to be replaced., biggest problem was a power cut it restarts but because wifi, the router is also rebooting, meaning the stick blacks out because it cant do a update check because it always does on powering up.Also no where as near as powerful as advertised - it couldn't run exviz cctv video stream on anything less than lowbit rate, while a chinese android box at half the price can. Maybe a bit of the processor is too low spec and the fact that it has an appalling 1mb only of ram! like a 1995 winPC!Was no use to me"
Skylar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product at good price,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"I bought this in the sale as an upgrade to my existing old firestick, and it is a definite improvement.  The newer menu style is easier to navigate and the picture is clearer. I really wasn't that bothered about 'Alexa' tbh, but am now converted! It makes finding programmes and films so much easier."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,The IT doesn't work,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2021,"Despite acknowledging that there is full wifi connection, it will not allow me to use the main menu. Voice instructions are completely hit and miss - mostly miss.  I ask for something simple like BBC iplayer and I get three dots going round and round. Occasionally I will ask for a programme and it will magically appear, but 9 out of 10 times - absolutely nothing.The sound has now gone. I have spent more time googling how to rectify problems than I have spent watching programmes. A complete waste of money and hugely frustrating. Arghhhhh!!!"
Simona,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed so far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"I'm very impressed with this little device, a great addition to my home. Easy to set-up, I plugged it into my projector and the quality of the image is impressive. Moreover, I was able to connect my Bluetooth speaker for improved sound performance. I can now control the TV with both my echo dot and the fire TV controller. I'm eager to explore what else this has to offer."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to install,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2021,"This was delivered on time, well packaged and easy to start to use. I brought this as I wanted to watch the Disney + app as soon as I had installed the firestick it was so easy to follow to add any apps that you want to add on, so I got all the apps I wanted. movie nights in now is just one click away and streaming with easy. Just what you need in the current times with covid and not being able to go out."
NanaT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,"Bought two sticks as Christmas gifts so I cannot comment on the voice recognition or Alexa integration aspects, unfortunately.  But I have been made aware that the picture quality was good - and the Lite version did not compromise the users’ enjoyment at all"
mdkett,5.0 out of 5 stars,Plugged in and set up easily,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,Liked the ease of set-up - a bit tedious having to register channels as they were selected but variety of films and programs compensate for this particularly as Amazon Prime member. Just needs playing with to get used to all of the functions - worth the price
Goldie29,5.0 out of 5 stars,Plug in and off to go!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 April 2021,This is an excellent gadget. Easy to set up and has a really good range of channels and access to platforms such as Netflix. It’s easy to use. The strength of your broadband/wifi will make a difference but I’ve got an average speed package and it works fine.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says it will do.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2021,"It is, so far, my only Alexa product and has worked any time I have used it. I can not comment on integration.It was purchased to backup very poor TV reception but I have limited data on my broadband so it is not on all the time. When I have used it, it has performed faultlessly through this first month.Amazon get a strong rating from me."
Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome bit of kit. Well worth a purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2020,Such a bargain for £17.... Highly recommended the stick lite to anyone that wants to bring smart features to their TV. I use mine with Plex from my home pc as server. Works a treat. Also lots of other things you can side load as well if you can be bothered.
Annie,5.0 out of 5 stars,great improvement,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2021,"I'm glad I acquired a newer version of the firestick. It is a great improvment over the one that it replaced. HOWEVER, when the day comes that I am so lazy I need to give instructions to a machine rather than pressing a button, then I will stop watching and get a life!!"
Ce'anne,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have in every home!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020,"I’ve had a now tv box for years but it became a pain to pay so much for only a few channels and seeing as I already paid for prime I thought I’d make the change to the fire stick instead. I wish I’d done this years ago! It has so many apps available to download, such as prime video, Netflix, starzplay, Amazon music, Disney+, catch-up tv and many more. I love the voice remote! It does have buttons for access but no volume or power buttons, I’m not sure if the other stick does. I will say, I love the fire stick so much I bought one for my dad and another one for my bedroom tv. Super handy to have."
Angela,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simple and easy to setup and use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,This is a nice unit which settled in easily with my Alexa family.  Easy to set up and use. Took a little time to get used to the different menu layout to my other firestick. But is a bit more straightforward and less busy than the other menu which is a bonus.
Danielle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Transformed my TV,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2021,"I wasn’t sure how useful this would be when I bought it but I’m so happy with it. My TV isn’t a smart tv so this gives me access to all the apps I’m missing. It allows me to watch NowTv, Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube and all the on demand channels without having to buy a new TV."
Maxie,5.0 out of 5 stars,This just hide behind the TV !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,"This little Fire stick is so affordable. Therefore, decided to have one on the kitchen TV as well. Works well with Wi-Fi, giving access to all the TV  channels I love.The picture & sound quality is top class. Got it at a good price on Black Friday.Thanks Amazon !"
Finn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2020,"I love everything about it . Easy to install and within a few mins you are good to go !So impressed, this is the 2nd I have got for my home. Lots of steaming choices which enabled me to downgrade my sky package and save me money, so they’ve  literally paid for them selves in a few months."
alexi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cracking piece of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,"If you have not got a Fire stick, get one it is a very nifty piece of kitAlthough the lite version is the cheapest it won't disappointand is a worthwhile up grade on 2nd generation Fire stickMuch faster and less buffering when streaming"
Nadine Hall,4.0 out of 5 stars,Annoyed as it was for convenience,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2021,My issues is I’m having problems with my device finding it unless I unplug it and plug it in again and it’s every night since I got it. Tried contacting Amazon and they were no help. I have another stick that’s a lite and no problems neither is the 4K fire stick but they’re on different TVs. The tv I’m having issues with is a sharp. LG and Sony work fine.
me myself and I,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2021,"Fab  easy to set up and install required apps.Voice command is amusing but difficult when playing with the diff languages (as you do )  don't need to buy the USB power lead it advertises to buy with it , as the plug lead it comes with works fine for it . Also chances are  , you can use your usual TV remote to work it (some times you need  to set this up via the TV,  ours just worked right away , found out by accident hahah)  will be buying another soon"
Happy shopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 November 2020,"Amazing device that everyone should have. This allows you to take your TV with you anywhere. Watch on your laptop or TV . Simply plug in , login to your account and download your apps. Then you have BBC Iplayer, ITV , Netflix, YouTube and many more. Perfect"
Caroline,3.0 out of 5 stars,Get plenty of batteries in stock,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2021,Remote eats battery life for fun and you have to really push the buttons sometimes several times in order for it to work . We have 3 so it’s not just a dodgy remote.As for the Amazon prime and Netflix programmes that we have they are great I don’t miss sky or the pricey bills !!!
gussie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"works fast , depending on source and internet speed, picture is brilliant",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2021,"took some time to get used to the new layout, but works brilliantly so far, dont feel any difference as using it with tv and projectors that controls not needed for , ok its two remotes or a remote and phone or tablet with fire tv app, but its working great."
ajt,5.0 out of 5 stars,Turned my 12 year old tv into a smart tv......,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2021,I'm a pensioner and easily worked out how to convert my old bedroom tv into a smart tv......so easy to use and have had no problems.....very pleased to be able to catch up with my programmes when my other half is watching BT sport on the downstairs tv.
TCISam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2021,"Our Sony TV is 6 years old, so not SMART.  This made such a difference.  Works brilliantly with the wi-fi, and can watch everything on every streaming service.  Love the fact that it plays YouTube so clearly.  If you haven't got a smart TV this is the way to go."
L Grego,4.0 out of 5 stars,ideal,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,"We ordered this so that we could watch Netflix and Disney + on our  Samsung TV upstairs. it was easy to install after a slight hitch witch may have been my lack of tech knowledge.Easy to use, only downside is that you can't put SKY Go on it"
Andy R,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best release yet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,Loving the lite version of the firestuck. Bought when at £17.99 so was a real no brainer. The UI is much nicer than my other devices so am hoping they will update at some point. Would buy again at the same price as replacements for the older models I own.
D C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value. Good picture.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2021,"Wanted this to get Apple TV, and Disney +. Plug and play dead easy. I have got prime on my 4K tv, and on Virgin Media, but the fire stick offers loads of apps. Personally I can’t see much difference between HD and 4K. The picture on this is top notch."
Joanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent little bit of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,Great purchase for £19.99 usually retail at £40.Fast delivery.Easy to install/upload.Simple and easy remote to use.Definitely recommend.We ended up buying 2 ! one for our bedroom (already have one in the lounge) & one for my Dad.
Tim D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s simple to use but can completely take over your viewing.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2021,"Simple to setup and use, easy to integrate with my existing account.Would be 1000 times better if it could give you guide showing what’s on now, next and before from all your selected channels. No linear catch up function on ITV.Highly recommend."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2020,I'm amazed at all the positive reviews. The Amazon fire stick reminded me of being on a flight and scrolling though the in-flight tv guide trying to find something of interest to watch - and failing! There's simply nothing on there that I'm interested in watching.  I sent it back for a refund.
Ian Guile,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fire stick Lite!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,The alexa is brilliant and it doesn't just control the channels but also answers questions and sets timers! There are hundreds of channels and thousands of films! Overall i love this gadget and can't recommend it highly enough! F A N T A S T I C!!!!
NK,4.0 out of 5 stars,Simple installation,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2021,"It is easy to install the Fire TV Stick with good step by step instructions.  Once installed and set up, there are no instructions on the stick's functionality.  After using it for 2 days, the sound was no longer there, so I had to remove the stick and put it back and this seemed to do the trick."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fire Stick Signal Lose,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2021,"Hi, the unit is small and compact , and easy to install and use. It does however have a problem. The fire stick frequently loses connection to the tv. This results in lose of signal, each time lasts about about 5sec, and can happen there or four times a minute. This is really annoying, it’s an intermittent fault but it’s really of putting. If I had known about this problem I would have had second thoughts about purchasing the fire stick.Regards"
mali786j,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb TV viewing and don’t need SKY anymore!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2020,Excellent and working superb. First updated and downloaded all programs using supplied power adapter. Then connected to Samsung LED TV 55” wall mounted and used the USB 2.0 port for power using a chromecast usb cable. All working perfectly. Do not need to buy Amazon £20 usb cable for direct tv power. Amazon firestick is millions time faster and better than chromecast for TV viewing of online TV channels and video contents. Simply awesome! Buy it and worth every penny!
nicola burke,5.0 out of 5 stars,so easy to set up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 February 2021,i bought this for my daughters room as there was no aerial it was so easy to set up i bought another one for the other daughters room.Now they can go and watch there own programme or the youngest plays gamesDefinatly recommend although i have heard using with alexa is good although we do not have one
paulbear,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Little Device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"Bought it during the Black Friday deals so it was less than £20.  Excellent way to add media content toa stand alone computer monitor.  So now I can watch podcasts, Youtube, TV series and films from my Amazon Prime account whilst in my home office."
munisha kobia,4.0 out of 5 stars,One of my best amazon purchases!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2020,"I love how affordable this is. It does everything I expected it to and so I would really recommend. I am a university student who wanted something cheap and affordable and it’s exactly that. I can watch everything on it. It also comes with an extra connecter that speeds up your wifi, so theres no wifi issues. The only downside is that it is quite small so easily gets lost and the Alexa aspect of it , isn’t really integrated as much as it seems. You won’t really require Alexa because the operationalising of the remote is quite basic anyway. But would definitely recommend for TVs."
LegendAlex,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2021,"Where do I begin it great for watching all your shows, it has various popular streaming apps such as Netflix and Disney plus and many more you are also able to get 3rd party apps too the only reason I haven't given 5 stars is the fact that after a month of use the back cover of the remote falls off very easily and is easy to lose.  The alexa works amazingly well and even does most stuff normal alexa does"
Jenn,5.0 out of 5 stars,Second fire stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,I decided as we are heading into winter and lockdown to have a second firestick for upstairs TV in bedroom. I also suffer insomnia and it means I have a wide range to watch or listen to. Easy to set up and as I owned all the apps  I wanted easy to download them
Chub,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb 👍😀,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2020,"My YouView box died and to get a replacement was gonna cost me a 2 year Broadband update or £160!Tried this and it's brilliant much better far than the YouView box.So, this and a year's Amazon Prime on a Black Friday deal Well Pleased."
Mr M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2020,"So bottom of the range firestick, bit disappointed this one doesn't even have TV control meaning you have no option to buy the 4K version.The major disappointment with this is that the 4K tv's are all mostly smart tv's so don't possibly need one of these at all."
ROGER D.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Prefer the older version.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2021,"Personally speaking, I don't like the new layout, found it hard to navigate around the new stick, preferring the older versions. The price reflects its features, sadly would not recommend, and would prefer to spend the extra and buy a 4k version."
Nick C.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Keeps dropping Wi-Fi network connection,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2020,"This version of the Fire TV Stick keeps dropping the Wi-Fi link when trying to connect to the 5GHz band of my BT Whole Home Wi-Fi network.  Works OK on 2.4 GHz but I can't stop it from trying the 5GHz band as well and it just disconnects when doing so.  Disaster!!!The older version of the FIre TV Stick (2nd Gen (2016-2019)) , which I also have., works just fine in being able to maintain the connection and switch as appropriate to either the 2.4 or 5 GHz bands on my home network"
Maurice Taylor,1.0 out of 5 stars,stick's probably ok (never used),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2021,I bought this because I needed a replacement controller and this was the same price as  a controller alone. It's rubbish - as all of the several replacement controllers I've had to buy in the past. They never last more tha a few months.  It just packed up working for no apparent reason. I tried 3 different makes of replacement batteries but it's just dead. The time for return was up until the end of Feb 2021 and now it's the end of March - so how do I get a replacement/refund Amazon?
gary whitehead,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is good!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2020,I've had the 1st generation fire stick for a few years now.It is slow even after factory reset.Upgraded to this and wow!Much much faster and impressedNot bothered about volume as have them on my remote.Alexa is great also.Upgrade to this
dc,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use but needs stable USB supply.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2020,"Make sure you have a good power supply. It does not like some USB ports like the ones on TVs. Apart from that, set up is straight forward and easy to use. Remote does not need line of sight to work so don't worry about where the dongle plugs in behind the TV."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,Very happy with my fire stick! Signal strength is great for watching TV in my room which my Chromecast seems to struggle with and it does everything I want it to! Got it at the bargain price of £17.99 which made me even more happy with my purchase!
Amazondg,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good value for money, very fast.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2020,"Just as good as the HD version. Using on a small screen for kids room and it is perfect. Just as fast as the HD version. Only difference is that is has the new menu layout which is fine. Not missing the tv volume controls  yet, but this may be a downside for someone."
Rich,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ideal addition to the home,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2021,"Bought as a gift but very impressed newer version than mine and it's noticeably quicker and navigation is a bit easier too.A great addition to any home that has multiple accounts Disney, Netflix, prime etc all in one place and can be moved from TV to TV 👍"
michael shannon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fire Stick O.K.  !0.1 Pad Not O.K.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,After the Fire stick I bought a 10.1 Pad and case. This is HOPELESS because I CANNOT enter my passwordto use it . There is no KEY PAD to enter my password !  There is NO telephone number anywhere to phonefor Customer Services ! PLEASE HELP !
Freddie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stop update on working items,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2020,Do not buy.Had my new lite firestick for a month was ok until new software  update.Now useless. Why update something which was working fine.Fortunately I have an older firestick which is working fine.If they update this one it will be going  in the bin too and goodbye Amazon. When I purchased the lite one it was working fine you have NO RIGHT to change something that I own.
K C.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well and good picture but some annoying features.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2021,"The unit is easy to set up and provides decent picture and sound. You may need to fiddle with the sound settings a bit though. The most annoying thing is that if you are watching a series (season) of TV shows, it often reverts to season 1 Episode 1 when you first switch on. Then you have to go through the whole lot to find the episode you want to watch. This only happens on one channel. Some shows start playing straight away before you have pressed play. That can be annoying too."
annmarie,5.0 out of 5 stars,great,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2021,never had one before but was easy to install plug in and get code from amazonjust got used to itand it updated now im trying to work out how it works againi like that i can use other apps oncool device
Wendy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,Bought as a gift. The first one to arrive was faulty but Amazon were extremely helpful and a replacement arrived the next day.Easily installed and the recipient of the gift is very happy with it. Easy to navigate around the various features. Great value for money.
MATHEUS CARMIGNANI SALVADOR,3.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome but lacks cell phone integration,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2021,"I had a Chrome Cast before and decided to get the Firestick. It is really awesome and it integrates all the best apps and services into one and it goes back and forth in between the services in a really seamless maner. But one thing my old Chrome Cast really crushes the Firestick is how well it integrated with my and anyone's cell phone. The Fire Stick doesn't mirror the screen, doesn't stream cell phone files, has few streaming options and overall way less freedom than the Chrome Cast I used to have. If I knew that beforehand I would've gone for the Chrome Cast again."
P.Preston,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's probably OK for Prime Subscribers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2021,I didn't get on with it at all.The voice recognition didn't work very well.It had difficulty finding programs I wanted to watch.It's probably OK for Prime SubscribersI prefer to find what I want on my PC or tablet or phone then cast it to my TV via a ChromeStick
moira,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I connected the Fire Stick to the TV my self ,",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2021,"I connected the Fire Stick to the TV my self and it did not take long before I had it working ,The photo is off the TV ,The Fall I have been watching the past few days ,I have not had any problems the picture is really good ,I am 64yrs old and if I can set it up anyone can ,"
Lost,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I wanted,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2020,I’ve been using a PS4 for my netflix and prime video for ages now and decided to get one of these little things. Cannot fault it at all. I was a bit apprehensive that with it being the “lite” that I’d miss some features of the original fire stick but if you don’t mind using the tv remote for volume then you’re not gonna miss anything.
Rosie,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING FIRESTICK,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2021,"AMAZING!! This devise is so good, it allows for Netflix, iplayer, Disney plus, amazon prime, itv player, YouTube etc! Very easy to use and the Alexa function is so handy, you can ask it to find any film and it will get all options up across the different services. This has transformed our old tv into a smart tv for a cheap price which is amazing. The picture is very high quality even for this cheaper version. 10/10 would defiantly recommend."
Capo,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY FIRESTICK LITE,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020,"A fire cube is best option of fore devices4k sticks , passableThe previous non 4k sticks were more than passable and the best option before being discontinued basically by Amazon to make people purchase the 4k or the new edition liteLite sticks .....not much to say .....other than....if you buy one you're an idiot , they are pathetic"
Mr. E. Wilson,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very good buy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,"I was a bit dubious about buying a fire stick as I wasn't sure how it worked or even if it was any good. In the end I decided to take a chance and got one. Just plug it in to an HDMI slot on your TV, link it to your home wifi and your good to go. I bought it just before Christmas 20 and so far I haven't stopped watching all the free stuff. There's plenty of free and also plenty of other stuff which either needs a subscription or can just pay a small fee to watch. Recommended!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why didn’t I do this sooner?!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2021,"I’ve only had Freeview up until now and never watched much T.V., but really wanted to access Netflix because of the quality of drama it offers. I really miss being able to visit the cinema. With so much time to spare in lockdown, I consider this purchase an investment in my mental health and well-being."
Lee A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The fire stick is well worth the price and offers a great streaming service,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2021,"Great bit of kit, very easy to set up and get going. Very good quality play back as long as you have a decent fast internet connection, the actual stick is well made and feels very robust.The only niggle is that I cant control volume via voice remote"
JHH,5.0 out of 5 stars,A wider world of viewing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,This was a gift and has made such a difference being able to view Netflix and BBC iplayer etc.on my TV rather than on my small PC screen. I do not have Alexa so can not comment on voice recognition etc. My only question is why did I wait so long before getting one !
esme,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sadly, you need this if your stick is over 2 years old",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,"Amazon tv kept freezing, crashing, very slow, etc, and got worse. Amazon said I need upgrade as stick is nearly 3 years old! Really?Now ATV is working fine. I waited till it was on special price. I do prefer the new menu setup tbh..."
Callum,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but broken quickly",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 May 2021,"I was quite liking this product for the first couple of months using it, worked reasonably well and ultimately did what it said on the tin.Unfortunately, that changed recently when the remote stopped working. While there's plenty of fixes available online, it's not a pairing issue. The remote has simply stopped functioning. Despite several changes of battery and multiple attempts to re-pair or fix, nothing has worked and the entire thing is now unusable.Ultimately, I've paid £30 for a couple months worth of TV and will now need to re-order as amazon don't want to issue a refund"
Tauren Jay,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but could be better,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2021,"The firestick streams well, and connects well with alexa devices to make a great home system. However it kept going to no signal and the only way to correct it was to unplug it and plug it back in again. Plus the remote isn't as sturdy or nicely finished as others I have used with other manufacturers."
Printskill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent purchase for the price,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"Easy to set up. Knowing a bit more about my tv controls would have made it easier. Picture quality and alexa excellent. Remote has frozen a couple of times; if the usual turn-it-off-and-turn-it-on-again doesn't reboot it, remove batteries and put them back worked for me. Pleased I bought it"
john solley,5.0 out of 5 stars,works really well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2020,"bought this so i could watch the Autumn internationals. received it within 2 days, plugged it into the telly programmed it with no problems at all. will now see over my 30day free trial all the Amazon channels and what they have to offer."

Robofw9,4.0 out of 5 stars,"One small glitch, then it just worked.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2021,"Bought to make our 10 yo Panasonic tx-l37g10b  smart (ish).  Works v well, only installation problem came from using a cheap extended USB cable I already had that didn't deliver enough power.  Use the supplied cable, folks!Otherwise, everything was fine and now we've got all the extra features."
Dan,5.0 out of 5 stars,top quality as always,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,I have 3 fire sticks in my house and this one was purchased for my daughters room and i haven't seen them since Christmas day i love the voice activation its fantastic that you can install apps and builds to enhance your viewing pleasure
sleeping cat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Alexa firestick , my old one was better.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2021,"Decided to update from my old firestick,  had it for about a month now but a big problem is a notice telling me I am short of space, never had this on my old firestick, done all I can to remove apps but days later I have they same problem."
Thomas McLellan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 October 2020,I like it very much obviously with no tv control being the only minus but I knew that before I bought it. It is so fast at downloading and that makes it great value for money. I would recommend this to anybody Who needs a streaming device.
sonia couzens.,3.0 out of 5 stars,fire stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2020,"Ordered as a 2nd addition, my other is 3 years old.The Guide button only show's for MY 5, Not any other's like ITV HUB,BBC iPLAYER, and All 4 even tho they are all down loaded. Then down loaded a tv guide but that isn't connecting to the fire stick either."
veronica June,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smashing upgraded stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 March 2021,I have had an Amazon Fire Stick for many years decided an upgrade would improve the quality and it does brilliantly.  The only problem I have is with Doscovery plus which I have downloaded but have to sign in each time I want to use it.
Kevin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad for the price,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2021,"With my Wi-Fi and Amazon passwords to hand, it was very quick and easy to set up. The TV button gives quick access to live TV streams, it integrates with My5 and Pluto but not iPlayer, ITV hub, All4, UKTV play or Discovery Plus. I am cannot install Virgin Media's TV Control app, it appears to have been removed from Amazon's app store. There are cheaper Android TV boxes with an Ethernet port, USB ports and Google Play installed. The Firestick is a dedicated streaming device, it performs faster and feels more intuitive than these Android boxes. Virgin's TV Control app is worth 2 stars."
Mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fire stick lite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 October 2020,"This is the second fire stick I have, the first being an earlier version with no voice control. Really easy to set up, just plug it into a hdmi socket, connect the power cable, connect to your wifi and follow the on screen setup. Great!"
M. Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great piece of kit.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2021,"SO much faster than the first gen one we had.  No more buffering, stalling, or problems connecting to the TV.  Some great new features too.  Integrated apps on the Home screen makes finding stuff on Netflix a breeze.We don't use the voice recognition so can't comment on that feature.Would totally recommend this new device."
Steve Harrison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value fire TV stick. Easy to install.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,"At this price great value. Replaced old fire stick and was  easy to install as downloaded from the cloud all the apps in my prime account to this new stickWith prime account a great streaming device for movies, TV and music"
Mr. L. J. Clough,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of time and money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2020,Faulty on arrival. Was stuck in update mode. Took ages to get customer support to understand that it had been trying to update for longer than it takes for any other of my previous devices. Still waiting for it to be picked up
Tractor,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best value Firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,Fairly easy to use. Good picture for 1080 HD. Sound good through an AVR. Prime video is marred by they own ads. Basic remote but works fine. Recommend getting OTG cable to easy expand internal app storage or removable external storage.
Daryn Murphy,4.0 out of 5 stars,Slightly different to original version but nothing to stop you buying it.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,"Basically the same as the original version, slightly different lay out to the original version, a little confusing if you are used to the original but same content and video quality. Doesn't control the volume of the television though."
cavywavy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very please with the firestick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2020,Brought this to use in my motorhome and have been very pleased. Was amazed to find netflix and bbciplayer on here to just needs skygo and I could use it for everything.Only down side it uses a lot of data and ic not found a cheap 4g sim to go with it yet
E.G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good update to an older Firestick, for someone not very tech minded at least",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,"Bought to replace a much earlier version Firestick which had become super slow and glitchy, and wish I had done so sooner - this is much more responsive, everything works faster and smoother. I'm not particularly tecchie, and had no idea what a difference a new one could make!"
Tony Miller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Major improvement on the 'old' Fire TV stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"We have been using the previous version of the Fire TV Stick for sometime now.  Our main complaint was the poor speed of response, and the time taken to startup certain apps like BBC iPlayer.  The Fire TV Stick Lite was a revelation. So much faster.  I would thoroughly recommend upgrading to this new version.  Well worth the money."
chas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressive bit of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2021,"Always a little dubious about new fangled (to me, at least) gadgets and have little understanding of wifi or connecting different devices but this was literally pug it in and off you go. The picture is actually better than via the aerial. There looks to be plenty to access but iPlayer and Amazon Prime will keep me entertained. I still find myself navigating with the handset when a spoken command will get me where i want to be thanks to Alexa. A piece magic for £30."
Jekera,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2020,"Perfect for 1080 use. I have the original firestick, one with tv control  and now a light version. Although the volume control is useful, not sure if its worth the extra money. You still need you TV remote to select the correct hdmi port for the firestick, so you will probably have that to hand to adjust volume levels."
B.L.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great piece of technology,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2021,"Love this product, cannot believe it took me so long to buy one. Fast, great image quality, I have all my accounts easily accessible....really like it. Not a great fan of voice recognition or Alexa’s functionality so will not comment"
gordie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Re-bought at a discount !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 December 2020,Appears to work fine for what I need but I did send back the first one I bought because Amazon then decided to discount it by 40% and they couldn’t give me a discount so it was more profitable for me to send it back and then re-buy it !How stupid is that ?
EDWARD HODGSON,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2020,"What can I say other than its brilliant, my only regret is that I didn't subscribe sooner. Its passed many a lonely time for me in these extraordinary times. Fantastic films to suit every taste without the tedium of adverts. Would recommend, very good value for money."
Midge,5.0 out of 5 stars,What have I been missing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,Bought this on a recommendation and haven't been disappointed.  It's opened up a whole new experience for me and just love all the options.  Setting up was really easy and having the option to use Alexa has also been very positive.
LondonClive,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says it will do,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2021,"Purchased the Fire TV Stick Lite mainly to get access to online demand TV as an alternative to Freeview channels. Haven't used it's full potential yet, but the first time I asked it to play something, the reaction was really quick. Netflix series and online films play (almost) with no problem, even with mobile broadband."
Mr I.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mostly OK, but shame about the sound quality.....",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2021,"I bought this fire TV stick to replace an older version (from approx 3 years ago) which I moved to a TV in my bedoom. Setup of the new stick went fine and the newer user interface works well after a few minutes acclimatisation. The big disappointment is the sound quality - it's nowhere near as good as that offered by the earlier version of the stick.  The sound has lost a lot of dynamic range and clarity (when using the same fairly powerful amp and decent, floor standing speakers). So much so, that I've re-instated the old stick and now use the new one with the bedroom TV!"
Sonja Greville-Seyes,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t attempt if you value your mental health,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2021,"AVOID,unless you are a techno geek.After4hours,I am on the verge of breakdown...resorted to  calling in a savvy friend.(also baffled) Maybe Bill Gates or a 10 year old would have more luck.I can’t and won’t go through it again EVER"
Mr Norman P Doodson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have to reboot very often when  I use it, which is annoying.  But once up and running it is good.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 March 2021,"I reported this to customer service and an extremely helpful representative talked me through how to set it back to factory settings and one of the annoying things has been put right, ie it would start a programme again from the beginning after the first set of adverts.s.  However I still need to reboot it 7 out of 10 times when I first put it on.  It was so time consuming setting it back to factory settings that I am inclined to just use it as it is.  Streaming quality is good and it is quick to change streaming services."
Fitpro,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great access to more than land tv,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2021,This was bought to replace a broken fire stick.  I should have got another with tv controls - it is a bit annoying to always have to reach for the tv remote control; fuse economy!  It's a cheaper option than buying a new smart tv.
Gemma hill,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 February 2021,"Great way to watch TV. As a prime member , it was a no brainier really. Good selection of things to watch, that aren’t on Netflix and other streaming services. Lots of football highlights and things I haven’t seen anywhere else. Have recommended to lots of friends."
Kerry,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic device.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2020,"I've been meaning to get one of these for ages but to be honest, I'm not great with technology & thought it would be difficult to set up. Then a friend explained how easy it was so I got one. It is SO easy to use, plug in, download your apps (iplayer, ITV hub, Netflix etc) & you're good to go. Fantastic little device plus I got it reduced in the Black Friday sale so am very happy!"
rahrah123,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good bit of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"Have to use the adaptor to fit my Toshiba tv, it works fine, took a while to set up.I use this in connection with my hot spot on my mobile.Would have been nicer if Amazon hadn't knocked a tenner off the week after I bought it"
Ojarm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2021,"This device has transformed my 1080 tv into a 'smart' tv! It literally worked straight out of the box. I also have an apple tv streamer. I need it to stream photos from my computer. It's always been a quality item and this device from Amazon is every bit as good. The remote is solid and well made. I just got the lite version. It could be my imagination, but I definitely think the picture quality is superior. I would recommend this product without hesitation."
Mr. M. J. Lincoln,4.0 out of 5 stars,Takes several attempts to sync audio visual but great when achieved,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2021,It always takes ages for fire sticks to settle into video audio sync with me even with the new audio sync feature. After a few system updates they sttle down inexplicably so with that knowledge I'm happy as this is a second one.
Toni,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Fire Stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,I was a bit weary at first to buy it but was told by my daughter and son-in-law that I would benefit from it and am now very pleased to have purchases it.  It has been very beneficial for my grand children.  Definitely recommend.
Mrs. A. L. Barnes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very efficient,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 March 2021,"Quite easy to set up - I’m 70. Isimply wanted it to get a good reception on a television in my bedrooms which, until now has operated poorly with a plug-in aerial. The fire stick has given me perfect and reliable viewing."
J. A. Waller,5.0 out of 5 stars,Faster than the old Fire Stick,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 January 2021,"Bought this to replace a 3 year old Fire Stick. Noticeably quicker. A better graphical interface too, which is easier to navigate (though the old one was good too). Certainly worth the money. Not tried the voice recognition yet."
Pat Jackson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value streaming,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2021,"Third one that I've bought over the years, always work well and a really good extra to have on your t.v..Always good value and effective, with little or no buffering. I use one in my motorhome, streaming through my phone."
Claire,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to set up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2021,"Absolutely brilliant, haven't used the voice recognition feature so I haven't scored it but otherwise it's brilliant. I'm able to continue watching a programme upstairs that I was watching downstairs. Easy to set up and use straight away."
Karis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2020,Shame it's got to be plugged in as it's an extra wire in my TV but the product itself is exactly what I wanted! Quick and easy to use and install
Sue Williams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Money well spent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2021,So pleased I bought this fire stick. I have been trying to decide about buying one for long time worried that it might be a novelty item for me. Not at all. It has brought a new lease of life for out telly watching. Most certainly money well spent.
Farmers wife,5.0 out of 5 stars,Base model but no need to pay more,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 March 2021,Have now purchased 4 of these for various of our own and relatives TV's. Very easy to set up and use with included remote. Improved picture even on quite old HD ready TV. Not sure why anyone would buy the more expensive versions.
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great streaming quality,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 May 2021,I'm only using this for streaming so haven't utilised the voice recognition or Alexa integration.  My grandson set it all up for me and it didn't take him very long at all.  I'm very pleased with the picture and sound quality.
Capt.Bob,5.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to connect Remote Control,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2020,The item was easy to fit to TV but I had difficulty getting it to recognise the Remote.Once the Remote was recognised the rest was easy.Excellent picture quality on my LG TV.Now my wife and I can be looking at different catch up programmes on separate TV's
